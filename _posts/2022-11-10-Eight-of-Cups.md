## Tarot Card Meaning
The Eight of Cups Tarot card symbolizes a turning away from and disappointment in professional or personal goals. We may have put a lot of time and energy into a project or relationship, only to find that our expectations are not met.

According to our expectations, we want everything to succeed and we don’t want to suffer any setbacks. But just when the negative effects clearly exceed the benefits, it is time to turn away and use our energy for new goals.

At first, you may find it hard to deal with the disappointment, but you will feel that a burden has been lifted from your shoulders that you may not have been aware of, and your path is suddenly much easier.

Another meaning of the Eight of Cups is that we spend too much in one area of our lives and feel exhausted and powerless.

In our professional and private everyday life, we often want to be perceived as self-confident, strong and persevering. Therefore we set ourselves unrealistic goals which we can only reach with difficulty.

Due to the inner pressure we feel, we invest all our energy in our everyday life to meet our expectations and those of our fellow human beings. At a certain point, we have no more energy to fall back on and burn out.

Avoid such burnout by allowing yourself not to be perfect and paying attention to a good balance between regeneration and our demands.

The Eight of Cups reveals that something in our lives is not yet complete and we need to look for the missing piece.

In our environment, this can be a sign that, for example, professionally we are looking for a new challenge where we can develop our abilities to the fullest and thus gain more satisfaction in our job.

Considered as an inner state, the Eight of Cups is often a feeling of loneliness and emptiness. A place in your heart is empty, leaving a deep hole. When you search for new acquaintances and friends, you have the opportunity to fill this void again.


### Love: Single
In a love tarot context, the Eight of Cups reveals an escape from your own feelings related to another person. As a single, you may have met someone and deeper feelings have already developed between you.

But you don’t let these emotions grow because of past disappointments in love and you fear being hurt again.

Don’t let past hurts stop you from finding new love again, but use your experiences to better evaluate and judge your relationships in the future.

Rejection and disappointment are part of love and help us to develop a better sense of sincere love.

The Eight of Cups signals that you are very exhausted and have little strength to commit to a new relationship right now.

Rest and gather new energy first because love sometimes demands a lot from us. However, do not remain in resignation, but search for a new relationship after sufficient regeneration.

### Love: Relationship
The Eight of Cups symbolizes that your relationship life is disturbed due to a deep-seated disappointment. Such a disappointment may stem from the fact that your partner has lied to us or let us down, which has severely disturbed the common basis of trust.

Depending on whether such breaches of trust are part of your relationship or only one-time events, you should weigh up for yourself to what extent such a partnership makes you happy in the long run.

Explore your feelings and look inside yourself, which feelings for your partner are still present. Then decide if and if so how you want to continue the relationship.

The Eight of Cups shows you as a couple that your relationship is threatening to fall asleep and has little energy between you. Unfortunately, it often happens in everyday life that each partner starts to lead his own life without the other. You see each other only briefly in the morning or evening.

Due to the little time spent together, the partnership loses its energy, which causes the feelings towards each other to steadily decrease.
To prevent this process, consciously take more time for each other by sharing a common hobby or simply cozily watching a favorite series together.


### Health

For your health, the Eight of Cups means that you feel very powerless and depressed right now. You have hardly any energy left to pick yourself up, so the days are just passing you by.

Set yourself goals again in life for which you burn and draw new energy from them. In the beginning, it can also be helpful to get support from friends to get back on your feet.

Furthermore, the Eight of Cups expresses a deep disappointment related to your recovery
process from an illness.

You may have placed high expectations on a healing method that did not materialize. Don’t give up hope and look for alternative ways to treat or at least alleviate your symptoms.


### Career

Professionally, the Eight of Cups represents a serious disappointment at work. You may have been passed over for a promotion or received little appreciation for your accomplishments.

In such cases, it is good to consider looking for new career opportunities where your talents and work performance are appreciated.

Another aspect of the Eight of Cups is that you have alienated yourself from your job. Inwardly you have already quit and are thinking about how to escape from your job.

Take some time off from work (vacation, sabbatical) and think about what your professional future should look like. Set appropriate goals and plan your new career path.


### Finances/Money

For your finances, the Eight of Cups means that you are very disappointed with a financial product. Your investment has not paid off and may even have brought you a loss.

Use this experience to be more careful with money transactions in the future. Separate yourself from unprofitable contracts and financial advisors who have offered you such investments and take your finances into your own hands again.

The Eight of Cups shows that you are looking for new opportunities to increase your income.

Inform yourself over the Internet and with people you trust which possibilities there are for a sideline for you. Beware, however, of alluring promises that will guarantee you a large fortune in a short time without any effort.


### Destiny 

For your destiny, the Eight of Cups means that you will experience great disappointment. But instead of mourning the event, you should turn to new things.

A disappointment is something positive because it literally frees you from an illusion. Use the experiences you have made to avoid the same disappointments in the future.


### Personality
The Eight of Cups reveals a personality that prefers to flee from unpleasant things in life. As a result, numerous problems accumulate over time, which can be overwhelming.

Likewise, the card can indicate a person who gives up even at small obstacles and turns away disappointed without trying any further.

### Past
You are fleeing from an important matter from your past. Face it because sooner or later, it will catch up with you.

Disappointments from past years have left their traces. You have less confidence in yourself. But you can give your destiny a positive turn.

### Future
You are facing a phase of exhaustion. Many simultaneously challenges will rob you of a lot of energy. Therefore, be sparing with your forces.

In the future, you will go in search of new life content. Be careful not to give up too quickly.

### Yes or No
Your question has been tormenting you for a long time. No matter how you turn it around, you just can’t find a satisfactory answer for yourself.

You would like to flee from the upcoming decision. Therefore, you should rather choose a no so you can calm down a bit.
