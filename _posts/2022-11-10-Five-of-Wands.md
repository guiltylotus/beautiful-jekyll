## Tarot Card Meaning
In a Tarot reading, the Five of Wands symbolizes a tense atmosphere you are currently in with other people. Such a conflict is very draining for all involved, which means that in the end there are often no winners, but only losers.

The tension in the air between you is almost palpable and even the smallest remark threatens to escalate the situation.

Hardly anyone knows how the conflict started in the first place, and everyone just wants to get their way in this matter.

Listen to each other and try to understand the position of your counterpart, to dissolve the tension between you and work together again.

The Five of Wands symbolizes the competitive lifestyle that you are pursuing at the moment. You strive to compete with those around you (colleagues, your family, or your friends) and win at all costs.

Such constant competition may be good for your own ego, but in the long run, it will jeopardize your relationships with others if all you care about is winning. You don’t have to constantly compare and compete with others to be successful in life.

Relationships of cohesion and mutual support are much more valuable in everyday life than the constant struggle to see who is better in a particular area.

The Five of Wands Tarot card also represents diversity regarding other systems of opinion and values. Different ways of thinking hold both risks and immense potentials.

Risks in the form of disputes arise when everyone only rigidly adheres to their own worldview and does not allow for other opinions.

On the other hand, the diversity of different systems of thought holds a lot of potential for better mutual understanding and personal development.

You can learn a lot from your counterpart if you have an open and tolerant nature, which allows you to quickly establish valuable contacts and ensure a harmonious coexistence in your social environment.


### Love: Single
As a single, the Five of Wands card represents that you view dating more like a competition.

Although you suspect or are sure that several people are vying for the love of another special person, you also want to flirt and “win” regardless of whether the person in question really suits you.

True love is based on mutual affection. You should become suspicious when someone is being courted by many other people.

Become aware of what kind of partner you would like to have at your side and make your choice according to inner rather than outer values.

In addition, the Five of Wands reveals a very stressful tension that inhibits you from meeting someone new.

The tension comes from your social environment and takes a lot out of you so that you often feel drained and exhausted.

First of all, try to relax your social environment to regain your strength. Only when you free your heart and mind, new love get back into your life.

### Love: Relationship
In a relationship, the Five of Wands shows you that you are currently stuck in a very far-reaching and challenging conflict with your partner. In addition, there are more people involved in the dispute, further complicating your life together.

Disputes that have been part of your relationship for a long time can now no longer be suppressed and unfold their destructive potential.

As a couple, you must now work together to counteract this and first persuade third parties to stop interfering in your conflicts so that you can resolve them from the bottom up.

Furthermore, the Five of Wands also stands for the living out of diversity and difference in a partnership. Just because you have decided to live together does not mean that you have to do everything the same.

On the contrary, different opinions and ways of thinking enrich a partnership immensely and contribute to the fact that you understand each other better and create new impulses for your life together. The more colorful and diverse a relationship is, the more long-lasting and creative your life together will be.


### Health

For your health, the Five of Wands reveals a high-stress level you are exposed to. You are fighting on several fronts at the same time and hardly get any rest.

That also makes you more susceptible to illness, as your immune system works at its limit. Take a short break and retreat for the time being to recharge your batteries.

In addition, the Five of Wands stands for severe symptoms of illness against which you have to fight. Often the fight against your illness demands so much energy from you that you can hardly manage your everyday life.

Support your immune system as much as you can by taking it easy and leaving your daily business behind to concentrate on your recovery.


### Career

In professional terms, the Five of Wands represents conflicts within your team. By focusing only on your quarrels, the real work is left undone.

At the same time, everyone involved experiences stress at work, so sick leave increases accordingly. Find a mediator who can help you resolve your disputes.

The Five of Wands reveals a great deal of tension lying on you and your colleagues. You may be facing terminations, so instead of working together, everyone is fighting for themselves.

Face the pressure from above together to show how valuable you are as a team for the company. Contact your works council/union representative to make a difference as a team.


### Finances/Money

For your finances, the Five of Wands reveals a dispute about money in your immediate environment. Topics of the conflict can range from an unclear inheritance to unpaid debts.

Do not risk your relationship with each other because of such financial conflicts. Try to sit down together calmly and reach an amicable solution.

Furthermore, the Five of Wands represents financial competition. That is about who earns more or has more fortune.

Often such a “competition” runs unconsciously between you and someone else so that there are conflicts between you from time to time on the subject of money.

Realize that financial wealth is not everything in life. Focus on the riches, such as friends and family, that always surround you and can’t be bought with money.


### Destiny

As a destiny card, the Five of Wands stands for serious conflicts in your life. Often such disputes are so obscure that you can’t identify their origin.

But instead of putting energy and lifetime into senseless arguments, you should find a way out of the vicious circle of injuries and fights.


### Personality
The Five of Wands reveals an argumentative personality. The person likes to go into confrontation and defends his views with all means, even if he overshoots the mark.

In addition, the card describes a very competitive character trait. Such a person loves to measure his abilities with other people and always wants to be the first to leave the field.

### Past
Lately, you have had to endure a lot of tension between different disputants. That has already cost you a lot of strength, so now you should retreat.

Look into your past and see what different ways of living together you have already experienced. You can draw new ideas from this variety.

### Future
You are facing a far-reaching conflict in the near future. Without appropriate social support, you will not be able to decide this conflict for yourself.

You will soon take part in a competition. Make sure you don’t take the latter too seriously and still have fun with it.

### Yes or No
Your request is associated with a high conflict potential if you do not take precautions.

By saying no, however, you can reduce the tension considerably and do not have to fear getting into further arguments. Thus you have more time for important things in life.
