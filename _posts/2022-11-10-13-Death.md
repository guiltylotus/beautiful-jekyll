## Tarot Card Meaning
The Death Tarot card is one of the most famous and, at the same time, most feared cards in the Rider/Waite Tarot deck. The fear is often based on the very explicit depiction of the death theme and impermanence.

The card does not predict our own deaths or the deaths of people who love us but, on a more abstract level, gives us clues on how to deal with the theme of impermanence.

The Death is very multifaceted in its meaning and, depending on the current situation in life, can initiate the transition into a new liberating phase of life. Death signals an end to our suffering or martyrdom, as is the case with the card of The Hanged Man.

Thus, you are urged to cast off the past and engage in your new phase of life. Letting go of old habits or relationships that you have acquired for years is a difficult process, but The Death encourages you to finally give them up to enter a new phase in your lives.

Death is also a sign of unforeseen misfortunes in life. Everyone, regardless of gender, age or wealth, experiences situations in his life that are unpredictable and very painful.

These are as much a part of our existence as pleasant and positive experiences. What is decisive is not the kind of life events but how you deal with or what you learn from them.

Especially in the case of serious life crises, it is important to realize that from now on, they belong to your biography and are therefore a part of yourself, just like all the beautiful life moments that you have experienced so far. As soon as we learn to accept and respect all the parts that make us up, we can swim along in the river of life without fear of sinking.

Change to something new is also a meaning of The Death Tarot card. That can mean external circumstances as well as internal changes.

External circumstances that suddenly change, for example, job loss or relationship breakups, force us to take action and adapt. We try to fill the void left behind with something new.

We then realize how urgent the change in our lives was and feel deep gratitude towards our new life change. Leaving inner attitudes behind is often a long process that requires a lot of strength and reflection.

But in a constantly changing world, we are required to question our inner attitudes and, if necessary, adapt to the new circumstances. Through a flexible mind, we can react to all challenges in life with composure.


### Love: Single
As a single, the Death card reveals that a new phase in your love life is beginning. Leave behind your sadness about a past relationship and open your heart to someone new.

Look forward and let go of the past to renew your inner self. Such renewal will help you to find a partner who will give you new perspectives and experiences in love. The Death means that an end is coming or has come in your love life.

That refers to feelings you felt for someone or a person for you. Such a break in feelings is completely natural in love and saves you from entering into a cool relationship that is only a partnership of convenience.

### Love: Relationship
In a partnership, The Death Tarot card indicates that an important phase in your relationship is coming to an end. In a larger sense, it can mean that your feelings for each other have gone out and thus the relationship is about to end.

In a narrower sense, it means that the first phase of infatuation has ended and it shows to what extent the partnership has endured in everyday life. Another aspect of The Death is the transition to a new phase of the relationship.

Especially if something changes fundamentally in your everyday life, for example, after marriage, the birth of a child or moving in together, your relationship life is completely turned upside down from one day to the next.

Your initial carefree love now gives way to a phase of common responsibility. Together you master the challenges lying ahead of you together.


### Health  

Although The Death Tarot card may seem scary at first, its meaning is more complex and encouraging. Regarding your health, it symbolizes a transition from a long period of illness to a period of slow regeneration.

Donâ€™t lose heart if the recovery progress is barely noticeable at first because changes in health take some time. In addition, The Death can indicate that your health is severely affected by a sudden event.

IT is hard to avoid such strokes of fate, but you can significantly lessen their negative influence on your health by taking care of your body and mind in good times.


### Career  

In a career context, The Death represents an end to your previous job. Such an ending can be a resignation or a transfer to another field of work. But every ending is also a new beginning, so you should take the chance to grow with the new challenges ahead of you.

In addition, The Death indicates that you should completely reorient yourself since you see no further perspective in your current job. Now is the right time to think about taking the step into self-employment or which further education could help you on your new path.


### Finances/Money  

In a finance Tarot reading, The Death card means that you should finally say goodbye to a long-lasting investment. Instead of pumping in more and more money senselessly, you should reconsider your plans and rather accept a manageable loss.

At the same time, The Death indicates the beginning of a new phase in which you can reorganize and rebuild your finances from scratch. Especially if you start from scratch due to a stroke of fate, this is a wonderful opportunity to review your finances and set concrete goals for the future.

Think about which contracts you really need and how much money you can regularly put aside for bad days so that nothing can throw you off track.


### Destiny  

As a destiny card, The Death shows you that your life is in constant change. To grow from these transformations it is necessary to leave your old ego behind, to develop yourself anew.

Each end of a phase of life offers you the opportunity to start again, to learn from your mistakes and make new experiences that enrich your life.


### Personality
As a personality card, Death represents someone who can accept things as they are. Through such an inner acceptance he can avoid much suffering.

In addition, Death shows a very versatile character who can cope and adapt even in difficult life situations.

### Past
You cannot change your past but should instead learn to accept it as part of your biography with all its facets.

You should finally make peace with a matter that happened far in the past. Better a horrifying ending than a horror without end.

### Future
You are about to enter a new phase of life. You will have to leave some things behind, but at the same time, new paths will open up for you.

A far-reaching change in your everyday life announces itself. Therefore, be well prepared for some changes soon.

### Yes or No
You are very afraid of the decision and fear falling back into old and destructive patterns. With such a high level of doubts and worries, you should decide for no.

At least then you are free of the pressure to make a choice and can concentrate on other things in your life. At least you will be free of the pressure of having to make a choice and can focus on other areas in your life.
