## Tarot Card Meaning
The Page of Swords is a card of departure and putting your own ideas into practice. You have already collected many good ideas in your head, which are just waiting to enrich your life.

Put your ideas into action and plan very concrete steps to implement them. Some ideas will turn out to be wonderful enrichment for you and your environment while others may disappear again.

In any case, by bringing new impulses into your environment, you will gain a lot of knowledge and experience on how to manifest your wishes and dreams in the real world.

Another meaning of the Page of Swords is that you should keep and develop your natural curiosity.

Although we humans have already accumulated a lot of knowledge about our environment, there are still countless secrets and surprises in everyday life waiting to be discovered.

By following the example of children, for whom our world is one mystical place where a new surprise is waiting around every corner, you will look at your environment with completely different eyes.

Donâ€™t just look at the obvious path ahead of you, but also consider the things happening behind you or hiding in the little nooks and crannies along the way. Use your natural curiosity to expand your intuitive knowledge of the world and try your hand at new things.

The Page of Swords Tarot card encourages you to seek the truth and increase your knowledge of your outer and inner world.

In the search for truth in life, you are often exposed to deceptions that, like clouds in the sky, hide the light of the sun.

Use your intuition and your mind as a double-edged sword to part the clouds of illusion and glimpse the truth that lies behind them.

Just like a sword, you must regularly sharpen your mind and intuition so that you can dispel even the most stubborn illusions around you and gain new knowledge.


### Love: Single
As a single, the Page of Swords reveals to you that you should let your natural curiosity guide you when first getting to know someone.

Instead of just asking the typical questions about occupation, hobbies and place of residence, you should actively listen and look at what information your counterpart is conveying to you.

Follow your natural curiosity and talk to your counterpart about the little things you notice about him. This way, you will not run out of things to talk about and get to know the interesting sides of the person in question.

The Page of Swords also stands for trying out new ideas in dating. Now is the time to change your outer appearance, like a new hairstyle, makeup or clothing style. Think about how you can turn your first date with someone into something special and try out new places or activities.
