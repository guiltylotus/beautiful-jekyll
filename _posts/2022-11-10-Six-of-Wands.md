## Tarot Card Meaning
The Six of Wands Tarot card represents a great success in your life that you had to fight hard for.

With a lot of effort and perseverance, you managed to overcome the adversities, as they were still visible on the card of the Five of Wands, and to reach your long pursued goal.

You have also learned how important it is to prepare long and sufficiently and adjust your expectations to success.

True triumph only comes when you rise above yourself and overcome challenges that few people dare to face. The greater the obstacles you have overcome, the stronger your self-confidence and self-efficacy will grow.

Furthermore, the Six of Wands stands for the recognition of your achievements from your social environment. Your efforts have not gone unnoticed by others. You will earn deep respect and recognition for your actions.

In a certain way, you even become a role model for many people for their own actions. With your perseverance and drive, you have proven that it is worth fighting for one’s dreams.

The kind of appreciation can range from a handshake to an award ceremony for your commitment.

Whether you have received large or small gestures of appreciation, they will boost your self-confidence and give you strength and motivation for your next life goals.

The Six of Wands encourages you not to rest on your laurels but to set new and challenging goals in life.

The personal development of your own potential will only succeed if you regularly face challenges that take you to the limits of your abilities.

Because only if your skills are challenged, they develop further so that you can reach beyond your limits in the long run.

It is not so important whether you realize your dreams in the first, second or third attempt, but that you learn from failures and stay on the ball until you have reached your goal.

### Love: Single
As a single, the Six of Wands reveals that progress in various areas of life will soon have a positive effect on your love life. You are very successful in your professional and private life and you are constantly working on developing your character and knowledge.

Thus you radiate tremendous self-confidence to other people, making you appear very attractive.

By constantly setting yourself new goals and challenges, you will also meet many people and impress them with your enthusiasm and drive so that the next love will soon enter your life again.

Another aspect of the Six of Wands is that an initial friendship could soon develop into a more serious relationship.

You have recently intensified your relationship with someone close to you.

However, do not act hastily, but proceed very cautiously in deepening your relationship so that both sides have enough time to try out a new love and, in the best case, turn it into a joint triumph.

### Love: Relationship
In a partnership, the Six of Wands stands for the recognition of the daily support by your partner in your everyday life.

Appreciation is an important cornerstone for a stable and harmonious relationship and is best cultivated by regularly giving your partner small tokens of appreciation and thanks.

Do it through appreciative words and small gestures, such as a hug or a kiss, which are worth much more than any material gifts.

In addition, such a form of recognition shows your partner that you see and appreciate his work for the relationship.

Furthermore, the Six of Wands shows that you as a couple manage to integrate apparent contradictions between you into your life together in a meaningful way.

Having the same values and ideals is important for a harmonious relationship. However, differences between both partners enable each one to grow beyond yourself and as a couple.

A relationship remains vital and is a source of creativity and joy by integrating different interests, opinions and ways of thinking.

### Health

For your health, the Six of Wands means that you are increasingly recovering from a prolonged illness. Your strength is gradually returning so that you can go about your daily life again.

Enjoy your health and life again. Celebrate your successes in the fight against your illness with your loved ones to support your healing process further.

The Six of Wands stands for joining forces with other people to achieve your health goals. A sport or a diet works much better as a team.

Each person can support and motivate the other when things are not going so well. It is also much more fun to share your successes with other people.

### Career 

In professional terms, the Six of Wands stands for a long-awaited success. You have been working towards a promotion or your dream job for months or years, and can now reap the fruits of your labor.

Use this precious moment to become aware of how much you can achieve in your life with diligence and effort and set new goals worth striving for.

The Six of Wands stands for the recognition of your professional achievements by colleagues and superiors.

Your commitment and work performance for your company have not gone unnoticed, which is why you are held in high esteem by all employees. The appreciation of your work expresses itself through a bonus or a harmonious working atmosphere in your department.

### Finances/Money

In financial matters, the Six of Wands reveals that you make great progress in increasing your wealth. You can closely observe how your wealth is slowly but steadily growing. Concrete goals and plans help you on your path.

You have already reached some milestones, but it would be a mistake to rest on your laurels now. Keep on the ball and in a few years, you will be able to enjoy comfortable prosperity.

The Six of Wands symbolizes that you should show gratitude to the people who have always supported your financial ventures. That does not necessarily have to be through monetary contributions.

Words of thanks or common experiences, given to other people, strengthen your friendly and financial relationship lastingly.

### Destiny

As a destiny card, the Six of Wands means that you will receive great recognition for your life’s work. You never lost sight of your goal and worked on it with great ambition.

You always cared about the well-being of the people around you, whom you supported with words and deeds. Let them celebrate you now and accept their thanks.

### Personality
The Six of Wands represents a personality that is very eager for recognition from others. Such a person likes to be the center of attention and wants his achievements to be noticed by those around him.

Likewise, this card reveals someone being process-oriented in his actions and thinking. He focuses not only on the goal but equally on the way to get there.

### Past
You like to think back to when you were united with dear people. These intimate feelings help you to overcome phases of loneliness.

In days gone by, you received a lot of appreciation for your deeds. Such a form of respect is a valuable source of strength.

### Future
You will soon make decisive progress in an important project. Your progress will be unstoppable.

You are about to achieve a real triumph in life for which you have been working for some time. You may present your successes to the world.

### Yes or No
You will make great progress on your question if you choose yes. A long-term triumph can come your way and move you forward.

Your breakthrough will even extend to other areas of your life if you stand behind your decision.
