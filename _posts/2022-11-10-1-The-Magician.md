## Tarot Card Meaning
The Magician stands for the fulfillment of your dreams, even if you no longer believe in them. Everything you need is already in front of you, like on the table of The Magician.

You only have to grab it and start to put your ideas and dreams into reality. Use your spiritual (fire), physical (earth), mental (air) as well as emotional (water) energies to finally make your wishes come true and manifest them in real life.

If you manage to bundle and channel the mentioned energies, almost unlimited possibilities are open to you. Just like the magician, only your imagination is the limit of what you can create.

The time of hesitation and doubt is now over. The Magician reminds you to finally step into action and become creatively active.

Your previous experiences, knowledge and perseverance, which you have acquired in the course of your life, are waiting to be used. End your daydreaming and decide to finally make your wishes come true.

Before your dreams can become real, you must have a clear and concrete idea of them. Become aware of “what” you want to achieve concretely “how”.

With a lot of concentration and dedication, you become the link between the spiritual and the real world and can transfer energies from one world to the other. Continue to be mindful while manifesting your dreams in real life.

Distractions are omnipresent and try to dissuade you from your purpose. Be inspired by The Magician’s dedication and steadfastness and remain focused and devoted to realizing your ideas.

### Love: Single
If you are currently single and long for a partnership, the Tarot card of the Magician signals you to get active. Make the decision not to be alone anymore and let your thoughts follow your deeds.

Everything you need is already within you. All necessary tools are spread out in front of you. You only have to reach for them and new possibilities in love will open up for you. You will notice how your dreams will soon become real.

Take the concentration and willpower of The Magician as an example. Don’t lose sight of your goal to enter into a new partnership.

Maybe the next opportunity is already waiting for you at work, at your hobby or on your way to the grocery store? Be prepared and not let yourself be distracted by unnecessary things in everyday life. Be mindful and do not miss the opportunity to flirt.

### Love: Relationship
In an existing partnership, the Magician Tarot card encourages you to live out engaging ideas with your partner. Maybe you have wanted to spend a romantic vacation with your partner for a long time. The pitfalls of everyday life have prevented this so far.

The Magician shows that now is the time to realize such wishes for togetherness. Plan with your partner how your new togetherness should look like.

Often your everyday life demands a lot from you and we feel very powerless, but through a time-out for you and your partner, new energies are released. Take the time for yourselves and feel the almost endless fresh power, which is also inherent in The Magician.

### Health
For your health, the Magician encourages you to trust more in your inner self-healing powers. To speed up the healing of an illness actively promote your health again, like through healing teas or cures and appropriate physical activity.

But even if you feel healthy and fit overall, it makes sense to strengthen your body and mind concerning upcoming diseases. Integrate physical exercise firmly into your daily routine and also strengthen your mental skills regularly.

The Magician also signals that you have a chronic or very long-lasting illness. You should take advice from a powerful healer who can give you new impulses for a cure or relief.

### Career
In a professional context, the Magician symbolizes that you should finally put your long-held ideas into practice. That will open up new career opportunities for you, which you can use to get ahead.

In addition, difficult challenges lie ahead of you right now, which you can only solve if you bundle all your knowledge and energy in a meaningful way. Do not let yourself be distracted by trivialities or distractions with colleagues, but always keep your goal in mind.

Use your power to give your career another boost by exceeding all expectations. You’ll be amazed at the magic you have in you and how you can enrich your job and transform it to your liking.

### Finances/Money
In a financial context, the Magician reveals that you now have enough financial resources to realize long-delayed dreams. Unlike the Fool, you do not take unnecessary risks in your undertakings but are aware of exactly how you use your money.

Observe exactly how your thoughts and behavior affect your finances. Develop new strategies to further strengthen your monetary security.

The Magician also encourages you to focus on the aspects and resources in life that will enable you to achieve comfortable prosperity. From these ideas, develop concrete plans for your further financial actions.

### Destiny
As a destiny card, the Magician stands for the realization of your dreams in life. Hold on to your visions, no matter how far or near they may be.

With appropriate energy and motivation, you will be able to move mountains and enchant your environment. Believe in your inner strength, which gives you the power to shape your life as you want it.

### Personality
As a personality card, the Magician stands for someone who is able to pitch in and make nails with heads. Thus, the person succeeds in almost everything he sets out to do in life.

In addition, the Magician describes a character who can fully focus on a task. No distractions from within or without can dissuade this person from its purpose.

### Past
You are still focused on matters from your past. By learning to let go, you can concentrate on the here and now.

Your energy from days gone by will now pay off. You can reactivate new powers through them.

### Future
You will have to do everything in your power to realize your dreams in the future. The shaping of your future is in your hands.

In the near future you should practice mindfulness. Thus you can recognize pitfalls as well as chances for you in time.

### Yes or No
You already have everything well planned out in your head, which is why a yes is the right option for you. The positive aspects of a yes decision clearly outweigh the negative ones.

You will even overcome obstacles that still arise in your mind due to your willpower and good planning.
