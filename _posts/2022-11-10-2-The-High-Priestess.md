## Tarot Card Meaning
The High Priestess is the patroness of the unconscious and teaches us the secrets of the sacred, hidden knowledge and unexplored mysteries in our world.

Thus, she stands in contrast to The Magician, who symbolizes the real and material world and represents the conscious.

The High Priestess can move the thin veil between the subconscious and the conscious without effort and switch between the different levels at will.

She shows you that there is often more to our world than we can discover only by eye. Dare to look behind the facade and lift the veil. Then you will gain new, previously hidden knowledge, which will help you gain a deeper understanding of the world.

The High Priestess Tarot card encourages the questioner not to be satisfied only with the apparent answers but to explore deeper and fathom the hidden messages of the subconscious.

The veil is only very thin and yet it blocks your view of the secret mysteries. Let your intuition guide you. Just push the veil aside and you will experience hitherto hidden knowledge that has been lying dormant deep within you.

To let your intuition guide you, sometimes you have to let go of old patterns of thinking and acting. Instead, let your inner voice guide you to the answers to your questions.

The High Priestess also indicates a certain degree of passivity. That means to withdraw from the active world a while and go into yourself.

What thoughts and feelings are present in me right now?

Where do they come from?

It is helpful to meditate or do yoga exercises regularly to open your mind to spiritual experiences.

This kind of self-awareness enables you to look behind the mundane facade of your everyday life and get more in touch with your subconscious. Let your inner voice guide you to new insights.


### Love: Single
In a love Tarot context, the High Priestess symbolizes the reflection of previously unfulfilled desires in your love life. As a single, this means for you that you should first clarify for yourself what you expect from your next partnership before you get involved in a new relationship.

The key to a well-functioning relationship is that both you and your partner can freely develop their needs and desires without harming the other.

Stay in a passive attitude and clarify your inner needs in matters of love first. When you are clear about it, you should go again dating.

Furthermore, The High Priestess Tarot card points to trusting your intuition more in search of a partner.

We have already a certain inner feeling about whether it is the right one at the first meeting with a potential partner. Unfortunately, we too often ignore this feeling, whereby we then enter into relationships that are only very short-lived.

### Love: Relationship
In a relationship, The High Priestess reveals that the partnership should be revived more from within. Often one’s own needs are insufficiently addressed in a relationship, which leads to resignation and frustration in love life.

If you and your partner talk openly about your inner desires, they can greatly enrich your love. Learn together to listen to your inner voice again and dare to let your dreams come true.

The High Priestess can be a sign, that both partners should devote more time to their feelings for each other, which unfortunately do not find room in everyday life. Try to create free time, in which you can again fully reflect on your common dreams and desires.

Learn to get more in touch with your intuition and listen to your body. Your inner voice will tell you which form of treatment you should try to alleviate your symptoms.

Furthermore, The High Priestess encourages you to withdraw from everyday life for a while to get back in touch with yourself. This way, you can recharge your batteries and learn to listen more to the needs of your body and mind.

### Career

Concerning your job, the High Priestess encourages you to live out more of your creative side at work. Often there are recurring problems at work that take a lot of strength and energy.

By trusting your intuition, new unexpected solutions for such challenges will suddenly reveal themselves. Create new incentives to think and encourage your colleagues to join in the creative process.

In addition, The High Priestess stands for the fact that you will receive unexpected opportunities to climb further up the career ladder or get a promising job opportunity.

You can only find out whether you will use these opportunities for yourself if you listen to your inner voice, which will always be a faithful advisor to you in such important decisions.

### Finances/Money

Financially, the High Priestess represents your relationship to monetary possessions. Examine your relationship with money and see what makes you happy or unhappy in it.

When you see money for what it is, a simple paper bill, it loses its power over your life. You no longer need to be dependent on possessions when you realize that the true values in life cannot be acquired with money.

Another possible interpretation is that you let your creativity and intuition decide more about money transactions. Your intuition will tell you quickly and reliably whether you should try a new contract or an investment or rather leave it alone.

### Destiny

For your destiny, The High Priestess indicates a high connection to your inner self. Many decisions that lie ahead of you require more than intellectual consideration.

Only if you are in contact with your subconscious mind and learn to trust your intuition blindly, the latter will lead you through all hurdles of life unscathed.

### Personality
The High Priestess reveals a person who trusts strongly in her own intuition. All her actions and thoughts depend on her gut feeling, which always helps her.

At the same time, the High Priestess represents a passive character. Such a person has a rather wait-and-see and very thoughtful attitude.

### Past
In the past you could always rely on your gut feeling. Get the contact to your intuition again and let it guide you like in the past. A mystery from days gone by finds its way to you again to finally be revealed.

### Future
In the near future you should slow down your actionism and rather wait. A passive attitude can save you from unpleasant consequences.

Your subconscious mind is sending you clear signals about your near future. Learn to interpret them and take your destiny into your own hands.

### Yes or No
At the moment, there are still too many imponderables that lie hidden. Therefore, you should tend to say no, so that you don’t get a nasty surprise.

At the same time, the tarot card shows that your inner voice clearly advises you not to say yes, and instead, you should withdraw for the time being.
