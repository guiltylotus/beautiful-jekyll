## Tarot Card Meaning
The Ten of Swords reveals that you are a victim of betrayal in your immediate environment. Someone has betrayed you and abused your trust to advance their own goals and desires.

You feel you have been stabbed in the back several times and are correspondingly frustrated and disappointed. Don’t let this get you down! Try to get back on your feet and get back on your life path.

Despite the great loss of trust you have experienced, you can now detach yourself from the person in question and end this relationship. Learn from this painful experience and reflect on it again for yourself in peace, to be saved from future betrayals.

Another characteristic of the Ten of Swords is sacrificing yourself for your ideals and experiencing martyrdom. Whether you denounce grievances at your work or expose inner-family conflicts, the coming time will be marked by much suffering and high emotional expenditure.

Of course, it is important to remain true to your ideals and fight for them. However, keep in mind that with every fight there are also sacrifices.

Most of the time, such a sacrifice consists of your own time and energy, which can leave you totally exhausted in the end.

Take care of yourself by allowing yourself regular times of rest so that you can regain your strength to continue your fight for your ideals.

In a Tarot session, the Ten of Swords Tarot card also represents a serious life crisis you are experiencing. Usually, this crisis is associated with an ending, such as a separation, death from a loved one or the loss of your job.

Often this type of loss comes very unexpectedly, so you have not had time to prepare yourself emotionally. The crisis hits you with such force that you have the feeling of losing the ground under your feet and can no longer get up.

On the other hand, such crises offer the chance for an inner new beginning. You must gather all your strength again and get back on your feet to continue on your path in life.


### Love: Single
In a love tarot context, the Ten of Swords reveals that you currently experience a personal life crisis, directly affecting your search for a partner.

You can hardly muster up energy and courage to meet someone new at the moment because you are too busy trying to get a grip on your current burdens.

First, create order in your emotional chaos and dedicate yourself exclusively to overcoming your current life crisis. Love will come back into your life as soon as you have your head and your heart free again.

The Tarot card of the Ten of Swords also shows that you are currently making very high sacrifices to find a partner. You spend a lot of time and energy to finally find your perfect partner and align your entire thinking and acting accordingly.

However, by doing so, you are making high sacrifices in the form of neglecting your friends or your work. Love cannot be forced at any price, be patient instead and don’t let the other areas of your life down.

### Love: Relationship
In a relationship, the Ten of Swords represents a serious betrayal by your partner. Your trust has been betrayed and you are emotionally hurt. Betrayal in a relationship ranges from divulging couple secrets to cheating and leaving deep wounds in the relationship.

Whether these injuries will heal depends on the extent to which your partner recognizes his mistake and apologizes accordingly.

Nevertheless, it will again take a lot of time and reparation to restore the former basis of trust between you.

The Ten of Swords also shows that you feel your partnership is a martyrdom at the moment. You may experience little practical or emotional support and feel abandoned by him.

In addition, you are the buffer for your partner’s moods and stress, which makes you suffer even more from the relationship.

First of all, become aware of what you actually expect from a sincere partnership and dare to address and assert your wishes and needs to your partner and thus end your martyrdom.


### Health

In health matters, the Ten of Swords stands for a serious illness that severely restricts your everyday life. You often feel powerless and depressed, making your daily tasks increasingly difficult.

Your martyrdom shows that you should urgently try an alternative treatment again to alleviate your symptoms.

Furthermore, the Ten of Swords stands for a massive restriction of your previous lifestyle so that you can get well again.

For example, you may need to go on a special diet or abstain from a certain substance (smoking, alcohol). But in the long run, your sacrifice will have a positive effect on your overall well-being, so keep at it.


### Career 

Professionally, the Ten of Swords reveals that you are on the verge of burnout. Your efforts and sacrifices over the past months and years are taking their toll by depleting your energy reserves.

Take some time off to regain your strength as fast as possible. In addition, work on your attitude to work in the long term.

Another aspect of the Ten of Swords is that you are the victim of intrigue. Some colleagues are talking badly about you behind your back and trying to damage your reputation.

As soon as you find out about it, you should confront the people concerned and get support from the staff council or superiors.


### Finances/Money 

In financial matters, the Ten of Swords symbolizes upcoming financial problems. Your account may already be deep in an overdraft or you may be on the verge of insolvency proceedings.

Keep a cool head despite the massive pressure. Then, dedicate yourself to reducing your debts. It may be helpful to seek debt counseling.

Another meaning of the Ten of Swords is that someone has deceived you and robbed you of a lot of money. Tempting promises and a relationship of trust with the person in question have made you forget all caution.

Whether you will see your money again is questionable, but at least you have gained the important experience of not blindly trusting everyone when it comes to money matters.


### Destiny 

As a card of destiny, the Ten of Swords means an ordeal lies ahead of you. You will come to the edge of your strength, which will make it difficult for you to cope with your everyday life.

Be sure to take some time off so that you can recover from your wounds. Also, get social support from friends/family and if in doubt, consult a professional counselor to help you through this difficult phase.


### Personality
As a personality card, the Ten of Swords reveals that someone tends to sacrifice himself. As a result, the person has hardly any reserves of strength to cope with other everyday tasks.

Likewise, it represents a character who suffers greatly from criticism from others. The person virtually puts himself through martyrdom and sees every remark as an attack on his person.

### Past
In the past, you had to make some sacrifices to reach your goals. But you were able to make some instructive experiences in return.

There were times in your life that were like a never-ending martyrdom. But you left them behind you and came out of them stronger.

### Future
Soon, you will have to master some challenging life crises. Believe in your inner strength and you will surely master them.

Shortly you may become a victim of betrayal. Someone from your environment betrays you to push through his own interests.

### Yes or No
The decision you are facing will bring you to a crisis. No matter what you decide, there will be unpleasant consequences.

However, with a no-answer, you can avert the greatest damage from yourself and do not have to sacrifice yourself further.
