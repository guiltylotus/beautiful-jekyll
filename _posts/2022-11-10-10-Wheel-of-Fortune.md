## Tarot Card Meaning
In a Tarot card reading, The Wheel of Fortune is a clear indication of a profound change in your life that is currently taking place. Such changes can unsettle you or have been hoped for by you for a long time.

Regardless of whether we evaluate the upcoming change as positive or negative, it allows us to gain new experiences and to grow with the challenges that come our way.

Because no matter if you are in a phase of happiness or doubt, the Wheel of Fortune keeps turning and will always lead you back to your “normality”.

The Wheel of Fortune Tarot card can also indicate a turning point in life. We are often under the illusion that we have complete control over our lives and daily routines.

That’s why we are easily thrown off course by both positive and negative strokes of fate. By accepting the flow of the world as given and natural, we will be well prepared for sudden turning points in our destiny and grow from them instead of breaking.

Only the karmic law of cause and effect allows you a small glimpse into the future. Keep in mind how your own actions here and now influence your future.

Another aspect of the Wheel of Fortune is the occurrence of chance in your life. Even when you have pre-planned important life events for yourself, there are always external influences that can disrupt your order.

But coincidences can be events in a positive sense. They help you, especially in a stressful phase of life and give you new strength. Coincidence is a companion throughout our lives, teaching us to accept situations as they are and to learn from them.

Chance has no memory. That’s why bad or good messages sometimes show up very concentrated. Therefore, enjoy the good times when they are given to you by fate and learn from the bad times.


### Love: Single
As a single person, the Wheel of Fortune card reveals a change in your love life. New chances to meet someone are imminent, but you must actively use them for yourself to find a new partner.

Be mindful in which areas of your life suddenly changes occur, like in your job or circle of friends. Often you miss your opportunities to meet someone due to carelessness or too much distraction.

The Wheel of Fortune encourages the inquirer to trust more in their destiny. That means not to wait passively for True Love to happen but instead to use the presented opportunities in your everyday life.

Trust that your destiny will reveal to you a multitude of opportunities to discover a new love and try to seize these chances with all your heart.
