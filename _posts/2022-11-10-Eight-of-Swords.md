## Tarot Card Meaning
The Eight of Swords shows you in a Tarot reading that your self-doubt prevents you from achieving your desires and goals in life and instead hinders you in many areas of life.

Your thoughts are the cornerstone of your actions, so pay attention to what you think.

By fomenting self-doubt in yourself and having little confidence in yourself, you will have great difficulty in realizing your desires in life.

Have more confidence in yourself and set yourself small achievable goals and develop a concrete plan to achieve them.

With time you will be able to remove the bandage around your eyes and see new abilities and talents in yourself, which were previously hidden from you by your self-doubt.

The Eight of Swords Tarot card also reveals that you are currently confused and do not know how to move forward in a critical life situation.

On the one hand, you want to move forward and face the critical situation. On the other hand, you want to run away and forget the challenge ahead.

Unfortunately, it is difficult for you to predict the consequences of your actions, so you remain in a kind of rigidity, and your emerging thoughts and feelings of fear and doubt continue to confuse you.

Free yourself from this dilemma by putting your mind in the background and letting your inner feeling decide about your further way. As soon as your intuition shows you a way out, trust it and courageously go your way.

Another meaning of the Eight of Swords is that you feel very limited in your choices for a problem.

You may feel trapped in your job or your relationship and see no other way out but to just hang on and keep going.

Your own thoughts and doubts tie you down more and more and rob you of the power to escape from your prison.

First of all, free yourself from your fears and talk to a good friend about your situation, so you will experience relief and get new perspectives and ideas.

By considering these new choices and opening yourself up to new solutions, your mental shackles will loosen as if by magic and give you the chance to walk your life path again, free of fears and worries.


### Love: Single
As a single, the Eight of Swords Tarot card shows you that you have strong self-doubts and therefore don’t dare to approach other people.

You may think that you are not lovable enough. That’s why you won’t get a partner, but at the same time, you suffer from your loneliness.

Realize that such doubts exist only in your head and that you can change your inner attitude to the positive at any time.

Put off your inner shackles and approach potential partners. You will feel how lovable your environment finds you and that you can find a partner for life like every human being.

Another meaning of the Eight of Swords is that you are very confused because of your ambivalent feelings towards someone. The first spark of love has already jumped over, but something deep inside you leaves a bad inner feeling.

Your intuition sends you important messages, especially on an emotional level. They can confuse you at first but at second glance reveal the truth about your counterpart.

### Love: Relationship
In a relationship, the Eight of Swords symbolizes strong feelings of confinement and being locked up. You might want to have more time for yourself and meet friends without your partner.

But your partner opposes this with all his might and thus strongly restricts your freedoms. Such a prison in a relationship only works if you put up with this shackling of your freedom.

By standing up for yourself and not letting constrict yourself any further, you will take the first step towards more freedom and your partner will have to adapt to the new situation.

The Eight of Swords also represents that you feel very powerless and exhausted in your relationship. That exhaustion can come from the fact that you have many quarrels among yourselves, which cost a lot of energy.

Try to create more happy moments in your everyday relationship that fulfill both of you, like a meal together or a hobby. Furthermore, small acknowledgments and attentions are important for your partner, as they mean that you care about him and value him.


### Health

The Eight of Swords means for your health that you feel very depressed. You lack drive for your daily tasks and threaten to slide into depression.

Counteract this in time by structuring a fixed daily routine for yourself. In any case, go to a doctor to have your symptoms clarified.

The Eight of Swords can also indicate a physical illness, which
mainly affects your eyesight. Perhaps you have not recognized certain distances very well for a long time, or you have difficulty in reading.

A visit to the optician can save you from more serious vision damage. It is important to take measures in time to help you see your surroundings clearly again.


### Career

Professionally, the Eight of Swords reveals that you feel trapped and constricted in your current job.

The same work routines are getting to you and you hardly can unfold your true potential. Try to free yourself by improving your qualifications and facing new professional challenges.

In addition, the Eight of Swords can indicate strong self-doubt concerning professional requirements. Especially when you start a new job, the beginning can be quite challenging.

Doubts grow quickly, whether you are up to the new tasks at all. All beginnings are difficult, which is why you should exercise patience. Over time, you will adapt to the different work processes and gain more self-confidence.


### Finances/Money

For your finances, the Eight of Swords means that you have lost track of your income and expenses. That means that you are constantly worried about not having enough money for necessary purchases.

Bring order back into your documents. Then you know exactly how much money you have left for expenses in the month and can plan accordingly.

Furthermore, the Eight of Swords stands for a strongly limited financial leeway. Due to high debts or expenses, you have hardly any money left for your daily needs.

You feel very restricted concerning your finances and often worry about not having enough money to pay your bills. Get professional help to get your financial situation back under control.


### Destiny

As a destiny card, the Eight of Swords stands for the fact that you are a prisoner of your fears and doubts. The more you shy away from facing your fears, the more they will bind you.

Alone it is often difficult to free yourself from your own chains of fear. Therefore, seek support in the form of a counselor who can help you to see clearly again and loosen your inner chains.


### Personality
The Eight of Swords symbolizes someone who is very narrow in his views. The person has fixed thought patterns which he tries to apply to every situation, making him less flexible.

Likewise, the card describes a character with strong self-doubts. He has little confidence in himself, which causes him to fall far short of his actual potential and remain in place.

### Past
Deep self-doubt from your past continues to plague you. You can do more than you think you can. Just take the first step.

You are strongly constrained in your actions by a past event. Do not dwell too much on yesterday, but look ahead.

### Future
On your future path, there will be several forks that will confuse you. Just follow your gut feeling and trust your intuition.

Shortly, your power reserves will be strongly attacked. Therefore, you should already plan enough time for recovery.

### Yes or No
This matter is much about deception. You have a somewhat limited view of this question. Thereby you neglect many aspects which are very relevant to you.

A no is, in any case, the better answer. Thus you can free yourself from restrictive thoughts and look forward again.
