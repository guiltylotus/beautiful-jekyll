## Tarot Card Meaning
The Six of Swords Tarot card shows you that you are heading for new shores to usher in a change in your life.

You have just come through a difficult time, such as a breakup, job loss, or personal loss, which has turned your life upside down.

You have realized that nothing in life lasts forever and is constantly changing. Therefore, you have to adapt your life again and again to the new circumstances. Thus, you embark on the journey to new meaning and happiness in life.

Do not let the past constantly determine your life. Instead, use the experiences you have gained to make your future happier.

The Six of Swords also reveals a time of deep sorrow you are currently stuck in. Just like the Six of Swords on the boat, your memories from the past obscure your view of your future life and the chances of becoming happy again.

If you live only in your past, the sadness associated with it will become more and more deeply embedded in your everyday life and affect the people around you.

Open your eyes and try to live in the here and now, then you will realize that our memories are nothing more than fleeting thoughts and you will regain control over your life.

Use your time and search for new happiness in your life. You will feel that behind every sad phase of life new shores of hope are already opening up.

Another characteristic of the Six of Swords is that you need a phase of recovery and inner reflection after a stressful phase of life.

The trip on the raft allows the woman and her child to calm down a bit and refocus on the future ahead of them.

Especially after a serious personal life crisis that is just behind you, you should take the time to reflect once again on the past and see what lessons you can learn for yourself.

Gather new strength and energy so that you are ready to take your future into your own hands again and shape it happily.


### Love: Single
As a single, the Six of Swords card reveals that you are still very much mourning your last relationship. Because of that, you don’t recognize the opportunities in love that are newly arising before your eyes.

The loss of a partnership is often associated with intense feelings of sadness and rejection, which can take us completely so that we constantly mourn the happy times and associated emotions that we experienced together.

But by turning your gaze forward again, new connections with those around you will emerge, allowing you to love and be happy again.

The Six of Swords also reveals to you that now is a good time to embark on the journey of finding new love. Don’t look back, but set your sights on meeting and possibly loving new people.

Pack for your journey cheerfulness, caring and empathy. You will be a welcome interlocutor on every date and maybe soon you will travel the world of love as a couple.

Another aspect of the Six of Swords can be a recovery period for you as a couple. Especially if you have just invested a lot of time and energy in joint challenges, you will both be exhausted and tired.

To remove obstacles on your way through life together again in the future, you should allow yourselves a time of rest and regeneration as a couple.

A short vacation together, a romantic dinner or simply a cozy get-together in the evening, each of these joint activities will help you as a couple to recharge your batteries and strengthen your bond with each other.

thank you for it.
