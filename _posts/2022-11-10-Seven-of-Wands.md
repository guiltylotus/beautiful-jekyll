## Tarot Card Meaning
The Seven of Wands reveals that your position, professional or personal, is being questioned by others trying to dispute your achievements.

Especially if you have many successes and correspondingly high influence and power, envious people could try to take advantage of you in a moment of weakness.

But you are a fighter and ready to defend your achievements and influence against unjustified claims until the end.

Through your experience and willpower, it is possible for you to endure such a confrontation for a long time, especially since you are in a good defensive posture due to your position and power.

Another aspect of the Seven of Wands is that you are surprised unexpectedly by hostility from the outside and have accordingly little time to react appropriately.

The confrontation comes from one or more people you never thought would think so negatively about you or even actively act against you.

Despite all the disappointment and anger about this attack on your person, you should not hesitate for long and quickly come up with a plan that will allow you to get out of the surprise attack with a black eye.

Once you have survived the worst, you can go on the attack again from a safe position and with more support yourself, standing up for your rights and opinions.

The Seven of Wands Tarot card also encourages you to stand up for your values and beliefs the more they are questioned or openly fought against by those around you.

We live in a time with diverse opinions and views of the world, some of which are very different but can coexist despite everything, if we treat each other with mutual respect.

Defending your beliefs is important and necessary when other people try to impose their own ideas on you.

Resist the temptation to conform at all costs, but stand up for your right to your own opinion and thinking and remain steadfast. You will be alone in your struggle for a while, but soon you will receive support from others for your cause.


### Love: Single
In a love tarot context, the Seven of Wands represents a surprising turn in your love life. Possibly an initially very promising love affair has developed in a very unexpected direction, with which you have a bad gut feeling and prefer to end the liaison early.

However, keep your eyes and ears open because love usually comes upon us spontaneously and unprepared and rewards those who can quickly adapt to new opportunities and make them work for them.

The Seven of Wands encourages you as a single person to persevere and remain steadfast in your search for a partner.

If you have found true love, use all your energy and perseverance to conquer it for yourself. Because only if you stand up for someone and fight for their feelings, they feel what deep emotions you have for them.

Often other rivals want to conquer your crush and against whom you have to defend yourself with the help of your personality and your perseverance. Sometimes the road to great love can take a long time, but in the end, you’ll be glad you fought for them as long as you did.

### Love: Relationship
In a relationship, the Seven of Wands symbolizes a deep-seated conflict that you have to fight out against your partner and other people involved. Your dispute now also involves close friends and relatives and you feel cornered by them.

Get support in this conflict so that you can get your frustration and anger off your chest and ask outsiders not to interfere in the dispute of your relationship.

Only you and your partner can deal with the problem between you and do not need outside interference.

Another meaning of the Seven of Wands is that your relationship is an important protection against hostility from outside. A stable partnership is the best retreat to guard against conflict or bullying and protect your own values.

Having a partner who will always stand by you and protect you when you have no strength left to fight on is one of the most precious gifts in a relationship.

By giving your partner the same support and protection in difficult situations as he gives you, your partnership will always remain a source of strength and fulfillment.


### Health

The Seven of Wands symbolizes a sudden illness, against which you have to defend yourself.

The initial symptoms can be quite debilitating, which is why you should take
good care of yourself. Trust in your inner self-healing powers and give your body enough time to recover sufficiently.

Another meaning of the Seven of Wands for your health is protecting yourself better against diseases. Even small measures such as regular exercise or thorough hand washing are sufficient to make your immune system fit.

Use the natural possibilities to increase your immune system before taking any supplement or vitamin preparations.


### Career

Professionally, the Seven of Wands reveals conflicts within your team. You often have to defend yourself against several colleagues, which can be quite exhausting.

You should also seek support from co-workers or superiors so that you are not exposed to such reprisals any longer.

Another characteristic of the Seven of Wands is that you should remain true to your principles on the job.

If your superior asks you to do something that goes against your attitudes and values, you can refuse to do it. Just because someone is superior to you, they have no right to give you morally questionable instructions.


### Finances/Money 

In financial matters, the Seven of Wands shows that you have to fight against several financial burdens. Come up with a strategy so that you can meet your financial obligations.

It is best to start with the debts where time is running out. Also, get support from friends or family so that you can regain some financial freedom.

Another aspect of the Seven of Wands is that you try to protect your assets from others. Some people may want to force complicated contracts or investments on you that only they can make money from. Keep your money together and only do business where you have the overview.


### Destiny

As a destiny card, the Seven of Wands stands for an upcoming battle against several adversaries. Although your starting position is advantageous for your cause, you will not be able to withstand this conflict alone in the long run.

Try to negotiate a truce with some of the conflicting parties to get on your feet back again.


### Personality
The Seven of Wands reveals a character in need of protection. The person is looking for ways to protect himself against risks of any kind and thus not take unnecessary risks.

At the same time, this may also refer to a quarrelsome personality. The latter vehemently defends his point of view in conflicts and knows how to defend himself even against several opponents.

### Past
In the past, you have already experienced some bad surprises against which you had to defend yourself. But you could always overcome them successfully.

Sometimes you seek protection in your memories of better times. Be aware that you cannot always dwell in the past.

### Future
A fierce conflict awaits you shortly. You have to defend yourself against several opponents and should be well prepared for it.

In the near future, your values and views will be challenged. Stand firm in your opinion and don’t let it get you down.

### Yes or No
There is a high potential for conflict in this matter. It can happen quickly that you have many people against you.

However, you should choose to say no in order to protect yourself and your needs. Stand firm and defend your opinion against any opposition.
