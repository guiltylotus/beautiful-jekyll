## Tarot Card Meaning
In a tarot reading, the Four of Wands reveals an upcoming joyous event that you have been waiting for.

For example, you face a birth, marriage or an award, which you have been looking forward to for a long time and now finally want to celebrate with your loved ones.

But before the actual celebration, there are still a lot of preparations to be made, which are necessary so that you can celebrate with your loved ones without worry or stress.

Therefore, plan the necessary details in advance together with people you trust very much and give some of the responsibility to your friends and family so that you can look forward to and enjoy the upcoming beautiful occasion.

Another aspect of the Four of Wands is finally arriving at your desired life destination after a long period of careful planning and hard work.

You have recently invested a lot of energy and perseverance to fulfill a very important life dream and now see its realization in front of you.

Only a few steps separate you from your goal, which is why you should not slacken your zeal or effort. Instead, enjoy the anticipation and be proud of yourself and your achievement in getting this far.

Once you have reached your goal, you can completely indulge in the feelings of joy and fulfillment and celebrate your success.

The Four of Wands also symbolizes the importance of freedom in your thoughts, feelings and actions. To be free means to lead your life as you wish, without constraint and independent of other people.

That also includes expressing your thoughts freely and living out your beliefs without fear of hostility or oppression.

Encourage the people in your environment to develop their potential freely by living and celebrating your freedom accordingly.

Freedom is not a given and you should be grateful every day for every aspect of your life that you have control over and express your joy accordingly.


### Love: Single
As a single, the Four of Wands card shows that you are already very close to your goal of finding a partner. You have already met many nice people and created a large circle of friends.

Your joyful and life-affirming nature makes you a very desirable person to spend time with.

You may already have your eye on one or two potential partners with whom you can imagine more than a friendship.

Donâ€™t lose sight of your goal and dare to intensify individual relationships to see if true love might be there.

The Four of Wands encourages you to enjoy momentary freedom and independence as a single person. Being single has the advantage to devote yourself intensively to your passions and interests without having a guilty conscience towards a partner.

In addition, you can intensify your friendships or spontaneously pursue goals that would not be so easy to realize in a relationship.

### Love: Relationship
In a partnership, the Four of Wands reveals that you joyfully anticipate an exciting time together. Events like birth or wedding are on the horizon and fill your daily life with happiness and anticipation of the time ahead.

Share your positive excitement with your friends and family. As the saying goes, happiness shared is happiness doubled. With all the anticipation, do not neglect the necessary precautions related to the upcoming life event.

The Four of Wands Tarot card symbolizes celebration and living out the joy in a partnership. Not only at weddings or birthdays can you celebrate your time and connection together, but just as much through spontaneous ideas in everyday life.

Take a weekend trip together or go to your favorite restaurant to share more joyful experiences and keep your relationship fresh and creative.

A harmonious and intact relationship is not a matter of course, but a gift of fate, which requires regular care in the form of time spent together and fulfilling.


### Health

The Four of Wands stands for vitality and a good healing process. Especially after a long illness, you will feel your strength slowly returning.

Your recovery will progress a little faster with each day so that you will soon be free of complaints again. Use your fresh energies to do something for your health preventively.

Furthermore, the Four of Wands signals fertility or a new addition to the family. If you wish to have a child, now is a good time to get pregnant.

At the same time, your acquaintances or family may be expecting offspring. In any case, you should make appropriate arrangements for the joyful event.


### Career

In professional terms, the Four of Wands stands for a successful professional conclusion. The efforts of the last months or years are now behind you and you can reap the fruits of your labor.

Thereby you have opened up further possibilities for your career path. Celebrate this moment with your colleagues and friends and let them share in your joy.

The Four of Wands also symbolizes a supportive and appreciative work environment. Having colleagues at your side on whom you can rely in any problem situation is a great gift.

Therefore, cultivate a good relationship with your colleagues by helping them or simply buying lunch for everyone.


### Finances/Money

Through such purchases, you feel the true value of the money you have earned through hard work. Be happy about your purchase and the associated increase in quality of life.

Another characteristic of the Four of Wands is to use your wealth to bring joy to those around you. Turn the mere numbers on your account into priceless experiences with your loved ones.

A meal together or a vacation strengthens your relationship and provides all involved unforgettable moments of happiness.
