## Tarot Card Meaning
The Three of Cups Tarot card represents a special time of fellowship. Events such as the birth of a child, a wedding or confirmation make us come together to celebrate and experience friendship with each other.

Such events are very important for us humans, as they let us experience a deep connection with our fellow human beings, giving us a sense of unity with our environment.

At the same time, such events allow us to simply switch off from everyday life and enjoy the pleasures of life with friends and family to the fullest.

As a result, we can once again develop more empathy for our fellow human beings and further develop our social skills.

Another meaning of the Three of Cups is to make more time for our friends again. Go out together again, to the cinema, restaurant or simply in nature and share positive moments.

By talking, laughing and being creative with each other, you will release positive energies that will enrich each of you in everyday life.

In a friendship, we often share common values and attitudes. However, you don’t have to be completely alike in all facets.

Through the diversity of your characters, you can complement each other wonderfully and will always have a lively flow of energy in your friendship.

The Three of Cups indicates a high creative potential, which comes to full fruition in connection with our fellow human beings.

Join music or art classes and be inspired by the different approaches to new skills. Creativity means creating something new and fruitful for us humans to enjoy.

In a community, we can wonderfully live out our creative potentials as we are constantly inspired by the new ideas and imaginations of those around us.

The common energy that arises at such gatherings has a positive effect on each individual member so that each, in turn, can enrich his own environment with his creative experiences.

### Love: Single
In a love tarot reading, the Three of Cups represents an upcoming affair between friends. If you are single, you will soon have the opportunity to start a relationship out of an initial friendship.

It has the advantage that you already know your partner quite well. Also, you have already spent many wonderful moments together.

Furthermore, the Three of Cups shows that your circle of friends is very concerned that you can’t find a new partnership and supports you with words and deeds.

Feel free to accept this help and celebrate and enjoy life together with your friends. You can be sure that they will support you as soon as an opportunity to flirt arises.

The Tarot card Three of Cups indicates that now is the right time to search for a partner.

Make a date with friends and go out to celebrate or make joint ventures. Such activities will result in new acquaintances, from which a relationship can develop later.

### Love: Relationship
In a partnership, the Three of Cups stands for the need for more community.

Togetherness as a couple is one of the most beautiful feelings we humans know. However, it is important to maintain contact with your friends outside the relationship.

Often friendships change when a person suddenly spends much more time in a love relationship and is accordingly only little available.

A relationship and your own circle of friends are not mutually exclusive but can contribute in very different ways to making us feel loved and accepted.

So consciously take time to continue to cultivate your friendships. You will notice what positive influences the time with your friends will have on your well-being and your partnership.

The expression of creativity is another aspect of the Three of Cups.

Creativity in partnership means embarking together on a journey for new experiences in love life.

As a couple, you can develop wonderful ideas to enrich your love, benefiting from your deep emotional and spiritual connection.


### Health 
For your health, the Three of Cups means to use your creativity to increase your health. Losing weight, for example, is much easier if you try out new recipes or get inspired by other hobby cooks.

It is also quite easy to integrate more exercise into your daily routine if you turn daily housework into a small fitness program (See Youtube).

The Three of Cups emphasizes the importance of community concerning your health. Doing things together is important for your mental well-being.

In addition, a functioning social network will help you if you ever become seriously ill.
It can relieve you of some of the burdens of everyday life so that you can recover better.


### Career

In professional terms, the Three of Cups represents the importance of community at work. Every employee, whether a cleaner or a manager, contributes to the existence of a company.

Accordingly, every colleague should be treated with respect and appreciation, just as you would like others to treat you.

In addition, the Three of Cups Tarot card stands for a reason to celebrate. Perhaps you have just completed difficult training or successfully completed a project with your colleagues.

Celebrating your own and your colleagues’ achievements is important because it strengthens your sense of belonging and is a good form of appreciation.


### Finances/Money 

The Three of Cups encourages you to involve your closest friends in financial matters. Because, unlike bank or insurance advisors, your friends do not get a commission, but are interested in your well-being.

Therefore they can tell you their opinion about a contract or a purchase quite objectively and honestly, which you should consider accordingly strongly in your considerations.

In addition, the Three of Cups represents that you can celebrate financial success.

That can be a long-awaited savings goal or a higher income, which will expand your financial possibilities. Enjoy your deserved success and use it as motivation for further upcoming goals.


### Destiny 

As a destiny card, the Three of Cups stands for the importance of friends and community in life.

Because together, you can overcome even the most difficult challenges in life. Already an old proverb says:” Shared sorrow is half sorrow and shared joy is double joy.”


### Personality
The Three of Cups symbolizes a person who is very sociable and prefers to have many people around him. In the community, he feels most comfortable and can fully live out his potential.

Likewise, the card shows a character who likes to party and enjoy life to the fullest. It is important to him that not only he but also those around him experience fun.

### Past
In the community, you have already been able to gather positive experiences in your past, from which you still draw today.

A friendship from days gone by is still a source of joy for you. Nobody can take your common experiences away from you.

### Future
In the future, your creative streak will be in demand at an important event. Think about what you can contribute to it with your friends.

Soon there will be a big party to which you will be invited. Use it to make new acquaintances and strengthen old relationships.

### Yes or No
Your friends have already clearly explained their points of view regarding your question. They only want the best for you and have therefore carefully weighed all the pros and cons. You should listen to them and decide for a yes on this matter.
