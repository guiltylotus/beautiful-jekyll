## Tarot Card Meaning
The Five of Cups Tarot card stands for a deep disappointment you had to experience. An important project for you has unexpectedly developed in an unfavorable direction, so you are disappointed and sad.

Instead of looking forward to the next opportunities that already wait for you, you remain in your regrets and sadness that paralyze you.

Failures and missed opportunities are part of our lives that we must learn to deal with and rise above.

Disappointments always have something good about them, as they free us from a delusion we have succumbed to and open our eyes to new experiences.

Through these new experiences, we learn to better cope with future challenges in life and grow beyond ourselves.

Another meaning of the Five of Cups is a pessimistic attitude towards our destiny.

Failures and life crises often come together in clusters and give us the feeling that we are cursed with bad luck.

We hardly trust ourselves with anything and look with worry and doubt into our future. Therefore we focus too much on the negative aspects of our lives and miss new opportunities that arise before our eyes.

Only if we have the will to leave the past behind and the courage to set out for new shores, our basic attitude will change decisively, whereby we regain more self-confidence and go positively into our future.

The Five of Cups reveals that we focus too much on our mistakes. Doing something wrong is still associated with many negative associations these days. A mistake is rather seen as an expression of failure or one’s own inability.

Therefore we hardly trust ourselves to do anything because we don’t want to fall back into this negative evaluation spiral. But making mistakes is the most important prerequisite for learning anything at all.

They show us in which areas we can still improve and indirectly lead us to the right solution. Therefore, cherish your mistakes and allow yourself to do something wrong. Only then you will be able to exploit your full potential and learn throughout your life.


### Love: Single
In a love tarot reading, the Five of Cups represents deep mourning for past relationships. Many singles do not manage to enter into a new relationship because they mourn a past partnership and want to bring back the beautiful feelings of that time again.

We sometimes forget that there were also many negative sides in a past partnership, which finally led to the break.

New opportunities to fall in love are like the two chalices on the map, right behind us, but we can not or do not want to perceive them.

Only by realizing that previous relationships and the feelings associated with them belong to our past, we can open our hearts to a new love in the here and now.

A negative attitude of expectation in the search for a partner is also an aspect of the Five of Cups.

Especially if you have experienced a lot of rejection in the past, this has a negative effect on your self-concept and thus on the dating process.

Try to learn from your failures and do not have too high expectations that hinder you, but simply look forward to meeting new people.

### Love: Relationship
In a relationship, the Five of Cups symbolizes a great disappointment in a partner. Especially when there is a lack of trust or support in the relationship, the common foundation that has been built over a long period of time is deeply shaken.

Disappointments reveal to us character traits of our partner that were previously hidden and from which we can now learn. The longer we are together with another person, the more we get to know their innermost.

Disappointments are a natural part of any partnership in this process of getting to know each other, as they show us our partner as he really is and not as we might like him to be.

Another meaning of the Five of Cups in the Love Tarot is a pessimistic attitude towards one’s partnership. That may stem from the fact that we have experienced negative relationship breakups in many phases of our lives and conclude that this must go on forever.

But we can actively work to make our relationships rich in positive experiences and transform a pessimistic attitude into optimism.


### Health 

In health matters, the Five of Cups reveals that you see little improvement in current ailments. Especially with chronic diseases, you have lost faith that your symptoms will improve.

Nevertheless, do not sink into self-pity, but lead your life with the disease and make the best of it.

In addition, the Five of Cups can indicate mistakes made during treatment or prophylaxis.

The recovery process will be significantly slowed down or even hindered. Try to have the mistakes corrected by a professional as soon as possible so you do not suffer long-term damage.


### Career 

In a professional context, the Five of Cups reflects a bitter disappointment that weighs heavily on you. That can range from a lack of a salary increase to a dismissal.

Even though such a setback is painful, you should not be discouraged by it. Learn from such negative experiences and use your knowledge to get your career back on track.

The Five of Cups may also indicate a serious mistake on your part in your job. As a result, you can expect consequences like a performance review or a warning.

Making mistakes is human and you should admit it without discussing it. By doing so, you show your counterpart that you reflect on your behavior and are willing to take responsibility.


### Finances/Money 

In financial matters, the Five of Cups represents a setback in your monetary plans. Such a financial loss is painful, but it also teaches you to be more prudent in the future.

Often many small setbacks are the foundation for later secure prosperity, as long as you are willing to learn from your mistakes.

Another aspect of the Five of Cups is that you are looking back too much and mourning missed opportunities that might have helped you prosper today.

But if you dwell only on the past, you will miss new opportunities that can give you financial security. Leave your disappointments behind and see what opportunities are right in front of you and just start.


### Destiny 

For your destiny, the Five of Cups means that you live too much in the past and mourn missed opportunities.

You regret too much your own mistakes instead of considering them as a valuable source of knowledge. Turn your disappointment into new hopes and use past experiences to make your dreams come true.


### Personality
The Five of Cups symbolizes a pessimistic character. The person rather assumes that things will fail him and looks very discontentedly into his own future.

Furthermore, this refers to a person who is quick to let disappointments in life get him down. Instead of looking at the positive aspects of failures, he focuses only on the negative sides.

### Past
You regret decisions you made in the past. However, they can still be useful if you learn from them.

Mistakes from past times are still present in your life. Try to finally correct them and free yourself from the associated burdens of the past.

### Future
You can expect bitter disappointment from another person soon. You should reconsider your relationship with each other at that time at the latest.

You are very pessimistic about an upcoming challenge. Do not only see the bad sides but actively look for positive signals.

### Yes or No
You are very afraid of making the same mistakes as you did in the past. Therefore, to avoid another disappointment a clear no makes the most sense.

However, beware of a fundamentally pessimistic answering tendency in this matter and pay attention to changing circumstances.
