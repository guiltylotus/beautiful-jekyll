## Tarot Card Meaning
The Three of Swords Tarot card shows that you are currently in a phase of great grief, which determines your entire daily life. Such grief often arises at the unexpected loss of a loved one and literally pulls the rug out from under you.

You feel exhausted and sad on an emotional, mental and physical level. Therefore, coping with everyday life is a new struggle every day. Grief takes time to help you process your loss. You cannot speed it up or stop it.

In the beginning, take time every day to grieve consciously and use a fixed daily structure. Ask your friends/family for support in this difficult time to accompany you and help you.

Another aspect of the Three of Swords is that you take many things that your fellow human beings say to you much too much to heart and suffer from it. Especially at work or on the Internet, we experience more and more verbal and emotional attacks that can be very hurtful.

But also in the family or domestic context, hurtful statements occur again and again. Instead of suffering from such hostility, you should concentrate more on the positive reactions you receive and record them in writing every day.

That will give you a more positive self-image. Self-compassion will help you to defend yourself against hostile and hurtful attacks in the future.

The Three of Swords symbolizes that you feel deep sorrow over a long-ago event or relationship. Difficult life events or relationships can leave deep-seated marks on an emotional and cognitive level that stay with us for a lifetime.

However, with time, most wounds heal. They often leave a scar that will always remind you of what you went through.

By looking forward to the rest of your life, and not just back, you will be able to have a fulfilling and happy existence, despite severe scars.

Your scars are a sign that you have a strong heart. It remains steadfast and strong even in the most challenging moments in life and always helps you to find a way out.


Upright Three of Swords Tarot Love Meaning

### Love: Single
As a single, the Three of Swords reveals that you are currently mourning a past love and therefore unable to give your heart to someone new.

Your grief is a natural process that you should take time to work through and learn from before venturing into a new relationship.

Only when you are free from grief and sadness can you allow feelings for someone new again and enter into a new partnership without looking back. The Three of Swords also admonishes you not to run after a relationship destined to fail from the start.

That is especially the case if you fall in love with someone who is already in a committed relationship and sends you expressions of love but is by no means ready to leave his partnership.

Such back and forth without a concrete decision is very hurtful and painful in the long run. Take the decision into your own hands and end this connection. This way your heart will feel free again and you can start looking for a sincere and honest partner.

### Love: Relationship
In a relationship, the Three of Swords stands for deep sorrow in the partnership, caused by mutual injuries and breaches of trust. Both partners feel lonely and misunderstood and canâ€™t experience positive moments together.

In such a phase of the relationship, it is important not to lose contact, talk to each other and work through the committed injuries.

Furthermore, try to bring more color into your relationship and create positive experiences. Such joyful moments create a happy atmosphere in your partnership again.

The Three of Swords card shows that you feel very uncomfortable in your current relationship and suffer greatly from it but see no way out of your situation.

Maybe there is a crisis between you and your partner so that you wish to travel back to the time when love was fresh and harmonious, knowing that this is no longer possible.

This realization and the current difficulties in your relationship cause deep sorrow and loneliness.

Do not take refuge in daydreams. Deal with the crisis in your relationship and try to find a way out together with your partner.


### Health 

The Three of Swords is a bad sign for your health and stands for stressful diseases or upcoming operations. Physical illnesses in this context are mainly related to the cardiovascular system, while psychological impairments contain depression and deep grief.

Even if this is a difficult time for you at the moment, keep your courage and your zest for life because at the end of the tunnel you already see a little spark of hope.

In addition, The Three of Swords Tarot card stands for strong pain that plagues you. That makes it difficult for you to concentrate on your daily tasks. Find the cause
of your pain and get treated accordingly, then the symptoms will disappear by themselves.


### Career

Professionally, the Three of Swords reveals a serious setback in your job. You may have received notice or had to give up your self-employment and now look into an abyss.

But every professional failure is also the beginning of a new phase of your career. Learn from past experiences and look ahead to the next professional challenge.

In addition, the Three of Swords can indicate that you experience mobbing at work. The attacks of your colleagues or superiors are getting harder and harder for you and cause great anxiety. Stopping bullying is not an easy task, so you should look for allies or consider changing jobs.


### Finances/Money 

For your finances, the Three of Swords Tarot card means that you face existential fears due to your financial situation. High debts or financial losses hardly let you sleep peacefully.

But only if you face your financial difficulties you will be able to conquer your fear. Seek support from good friends or professional counseling to get back on your feet.

In addition, the Three of Swords represents that unexpected strokes of fate, such as divorce or job loss, will greatly affect your finances.

Due to your own emotional instability, you run the risk of falling into a debt trap. Even if you are only thinking about your life crisis, you should not neglect your money matters.


### Destiny 

As a fate card, the Three of Swords stands for difficult life crises that still lie ahead of you.

Even if such experiences are very painful, they show us how valuable times of harmony and peace are. Difficult phases are part of life and offer unique opportunities to grow beyond yourself.


### Personality
The Three of Swords represents a person who takes things very much to heart. As a result, he quickly suffers grief and finds it difficult to find a way out of his grief again.

At the same time, it can represent someone who is extremely sensitive to pain. That refers mainly to the psychological level so that even small conflicts can affect the person.

### Past
An old love affair still causes heartache in you when you think about it. Finally, let go of the past and open yourself to new people.

You still feel sorrow for not having achieved everything you wanted in your life so far.

### Future
Soon, you will be confronted with a painful event. Even if it demands a lot from you, you should not despair and continue to go your way.

You are facing a period of mourning because an unforeseen event will throw you off track. Good friends can help you get back on your feet.

### Yes or No
Your question is causing you quite a lot of grief. You have already invested a lot of thoughts and feelings in the matter in question.

Even if it hurts, you should decide for a no. This way, you avoid even more suffering and can get some peace.
