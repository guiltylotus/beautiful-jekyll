## Tarot Card Meaning
The Judgment Tarot card indicates that you are on the verge of an important spiritual breakthrough or awakening in your life.

Especially if you have been searching for a new meaning to your current phase of life for a long time, an answer will soon reveal itself to you that is often closer than you realize.

The process of awakening and realizing an answer to important life questions often comes abruptly when we are busy with completely different things in our daily lives.

When your mind is free and open, you can allow new spiritual experiences. You awaken, so to speak, from a dream that represents our old self and rise as a new person.

The Judgment encourages you to follow your inner call. Often we ignore the inner voice that wants to help us to follow our predetermined path in life.

Instead, we allow external voices to dictate a destiny that we do not want or that was not predestined for us. But just as the trombone itself brings the dead back to life, the inner call within us for our destiny becomes louder and louder and cannot be ignored.

Follow the sound of your inner voice and it will lead you back to your destiny path. You will recognize how much easier your life path feels and are getting closer to happiness in life.

Another aspect of the Judgment card is the appearance of an important decision in your life. That is a decisive reorientation of your life path so far, which is why you have to choose one of the paths ahead of you with a lot of thought and consideration.

Trust your own intuition. It will show you the direction you have to move and report back to you as soon as you deviate too much from your predetermined path.

Consider the choices you have made so far in your life. Use the experience you have already gained to weigh the choices in front of you in the best possible way.

### Love: Single
In a love Tarot reading, the Judgment card reveals that an important decision regarding your single life is coming up. Such decisions usually have a long-term consequence, for example, whether you want to move in with a new love already or you want to reveal your love feelings to a close person.

Weigh your decision carefully and try to listen to your inner voice and trust it. Keep in mind that there are often no clear right or wrong choices. Use every decision to learn from it.

The Judgment further indicates that you should follow your inner call in love. That means that you must first look within yourself to perceive your own inner voice.

You feel your inner call not only through words but more often through feelings. Especially if you are unsure whether a new acquaintance can develop into something more, listen to the call of your inner voice. It will show you the way.

### Love: Relationship
In a relationship, the Judgment Tarot card reveals a release from a serious crisis. In a partnership, there are always difficult challenges that put a lot of stress and strain on the relationship, sometimes even over a very long period of time.

Through the Judgment card, it becomes clear that such a crisis will soon come to an end and a solution is in sight. However, this redemption you have both been hoping for can only take place if both of you are ready to accept the solution offered without reservation, even if it demands a lot from you.

Furthermore, the Judgment card encourages you to make important decisions now for your future life together, such as starting a family or moving. You both must decide on a mutual agreement. It will change both of your lives significantly.

However, it is precisely such far-reaching agreements and jointly made decisions that will be a very stable and sustainable foundation for your partnership.

### Finances/Money

In a finance Tarot reading, the Judgment announces the end of a debt burden that has lasted for a long time. Once your debts are completely settled, you will feel a sense of release.

You can now look ahead again and finally afford something or save towards a new goal. Another aspect of the Judgment regarding your finances is to weigh well which longer-term purchases you want to make in the future.

A new car may seem very tempting at first glance, but perhaps the modernization of your house is just more important for your well-being and that of your family. Therefore, take a long-term view of how your investments would affect your daily life.
