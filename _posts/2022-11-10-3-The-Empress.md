## Tarot Card Meaning
The Empress Tarot card represents the feminine side that is in all of us. It is characterized by great care for others, sensuality, fertility and creativity.

Whether man or woman in each of us are female parts, which are more or less pronounced. Let these parts unfold freely and feel the energization and fulfillment that emanate from them.

The time is ripe to help your creativity find new expression. For example, take up a hobby in the artistic field. The need for caring can also be strong within us. It is characterized by how you can help others, for example, in your neighborhood or at work.

The Empress also symbolizes abundance and plenty surrounding you right now. Enjoy this phase of prosperity and try to experience it with all your senses. Abundance does not always mean material prosperity.

The Empress Tarot card encourages us to look at the immaterial wealth that surrounds us, like relationships with valuable fellow human beings, nature in its beauty or the joy of art.

Do not let this wealth simply pass you by, but use it to sensitize and develop your senses of seeing, hearing, tasting, touching and smelling. Thereby, you will be able to perceive your environment more consciously and enjoy it more intensively.

The connection to nature is also an important message of the Tarot card of The Empress. Especially in modern times, we are losing more and more contact with nature, the source of all life.

The Empress encourages us to go out again and perceive nature with all our senses. A regular walk in the woods or working in the garden can already be suitable for this. Through this experienced connection with Mother Earth, new ideas and perspectives arise for you again.

At the same time, nature is a place where you can relax and recharge your batteries. It helps you to cope with the hectic pace of everyday life.


### Love: Single
When you are single, the Empress Tarot card shows that you can dare to present yourself more outwardly when looking for a partner.

Try out new outfits or cosmetics and feel with all your senses what reactions this change triggers in you and those around you.

The Empress shows you that now is a good time for choosing a partner, with high chances of success for your search for True Love.

Learn to trust your senses again in matters of love. They will give you signals if someone is the right one for you. Don’t just rely on your eyes.

Also, use your ears, your sense of smell and your sense of touch. If there is a great fit between you and your flirting partner, your senses will harmonize very strongly.

### Love: Relationship
If you are in a relationship, The Empress reveals that you should enrich your love life further. Spend more time together and use it to get even closer.

The more vital and fulfilled a partnership is, the more happiness and joy it will give to the lovers. Try to rediscover your relationship with all your senses. Good possibilities are like massages, restaurant visits or common cinema evenings.

The Empress Tarot card means that you will experience your love even more in harmony with Mother Nature. Joint outdoor activities, such as hiking or climbing, strengthen the feeling of togetherness and also bring you very close to nature.

The experiences and energies gained in this way will have a positive effect on your love life. Furthermore, the card of The Empress indicates a great need for care.

This need can be for yourself as well as for your partner. Talk about where you would like to see more care from each other and make plans to integrate these wishes more into your everyday life.

Another message from The Empress can be an upcoming pregnancy or birth of a child. If you as a couple have a desire to have a child, now is the right time to try and get pregnant.


### Health

The Empress stands for the return to the remedies of nature, which can not only alleviate diseases but also prevent them to the same extent. The connection to Mother Earth helps to reactivate the body’s self-healing powers.

Even small everyday treatments such as herbal teas, herbal poultices, or purification cures help to strengthen your health when used correctly. At the same time, the Empress stands for a fertile phase of life and is particularly favorable if you wish to have children or are pregnant.

### Finances/Money

But is money really everything in life?

Does money make you happy?

Let these questions go through your mind and consider sharing your wealth with other people.

Even with a small donation, you can help other people and thus share your happiness. Use your wealth to indulge your senses.

Money alone has no value if you do not allow yourself to enrich your life with it. Allow your senses the luxury of a good meal or a massage, then your money will be well spent.


### Destiny

For your destiny, The Empress reveals to you the dawn of a fruitful and productive phase of life. A time of abundance and prosperity lies ahead of you, in which you can recharge your batteries.
