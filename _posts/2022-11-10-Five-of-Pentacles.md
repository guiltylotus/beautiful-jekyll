## Tarot Card Meaning
The Five of Pentacles card symbolizes a great loss and poverty in your life that has a lasting effect on your daily life. Such a loss can refer to material things but also our professional and private life.

You lose important resources in life for example through the loss of your job or the loss of a loved one through death or illness. You feel very weakened and look with worry and fear into your future.

Now you must activate all the resources you still have, such as friends or family, and try to fill the gap with new confidence and hope, so that you can enrich your life with positive moments again.

Another meaning of the Five of Pentacles shows that you feel very alone and abandoned. You have experienced a lot of rejection from other persons in the past, where you would have expected help. The loneliness causes you to reduce contact with other people and wander around alone.

To be rejected by a loved one is very painful, but it can also be a wake-up call for you to take the solutions for your problems into your own hands again and to fall back on other resources.

Be yourself light in the darkness and you will receive help and fellowship from various places with which you can rebuild your life.

The Five of Pentacles reveals, that you are focusing too much on your problems and completely ignoring obvious solutions. If you always focus on your problems, they will become worse and bigger than they are.

The wrong focus causes fear of loss and worries about your own future, without any of these fears becoming true. But the more you have such catastrophizing thoughts, the more likely they will become reality.

Instead, shift your focus to the various resources and help available to you in your immediate environment.

Whether you ask a friend for help or try to see your problems as new opportunities, only when you take the first step toward solution-oriented action will your worries and fears dissipate.


### Love: Single
In a Love Tarot reading, the Five of Pentacles reveals that you have a strong fear of rejection when looking for a partner.

No one likes to experience rejection, especially when it comes to love, but it is a natural part of our lives and only signals that our counterpart cannot build deeper feelings towards us.

It does not make you inferior or a bad person, on the contrary, rejection can help you not to cling to one person unnecessarily long, but to open your heart to a new partner.

The Five of Pentacles also shows that you have worries about your own future, which negatively affects your efforts to find a partner. You are barely focused on your dates and seem very distressed and distracted from your counterpart.

Devote yourself to overcoming your fears about the future and approach them actively and solution-oriented, so that you can again muster energy and strength for the partner search.

### Love: Relationship
In a partnership, the Five of Pentacles symbolizes a great fear of loss towards your partner. Perhaps you have just had a major conflict or crisis, which has put a great strain on your relationship with each other. You are afraid of losing your partner and cling to him even more.

But by doing so, you only cause him to withdraw even more and want his peace. Give your partner and yourself time and space to get clear about your current relationship crisis and then seek the conversation with each other to clarify how your partnership should go on in the future.

Another meaning of the Five of Pentacles for a relationship is that you as a couple are currently experiencing existential poverty, which is causing your partnership to suffer greatly.

In particular, the loss of your job and the associated income is a great stressor for yourself and your relationship.

Instead of blaming each other or stirring up fears, consider together what steps you must take now so that you can get out of your financial predicament.

Only with united forces, you survive the coming time of renunciation and fight your way back up out of poverty.


### Health

Regarding your health, the Five of Pentacles signifies a prolonged state of illness. Although your symptoms do not subside, you have not yet accepted medical help.

As a result, there is a danger that your symptoms will continue to worsen. Therefore, make an appointment with a doctor quickly to clarify your symptoms.

Furthermore, the Five of Pentacles reveals the difficulty of getting an appointment with a specialist. No matter where you call, you don’t get a medical appointment right now, or only in a few weeks/months.

Do not give up on your plan and persistently call all the specialists in your area several times. Also, contact your health insurance company, which should help you find an appointment.


### Career

In a professional context, the Five of Pentacles represents a rejection in your job search. Most of your applications come back unanswered and interviews are rather the exception.

Such rejections can quickly lead to self-doubt about your abilities. But maybe your talents don’t match the jobs you have chosen. Therefore, target more job offers that match your skills.

In addition, the Five of Pentacles can indicate a job loss. Quitting your job can trigger existential and future fears.

Don’t let this fear paralyze you, but first take all the necessary steps to avoid financial hardship (apply for welfare, etc.). Then you can apply for new jobs in peace.


### Finances/Money

In financial matters, the Five of Pentacles represents serious money worries that plague you. You can hardly fall back on money reserves and have to turn over every penny twice.

First of all, concentrate on having a regular cash flow again to cover your basic costs. Get additional support (counseling centers, family) from the outside to find a way out of poverty again.

Another meaning of the Five of Pentacles is that you have difficulty getting financial help. For example, an urgently needed loan is not granted to you or applications for social benefits are rejected.

In any case, you should not get down on yourself and continue to fight for the financial means you are entitled to, if necessary with legal support.


### Destiny

For your destiny, the Five of Pentacles reveals a time of austerity. You will have to tighten your belt considerably and restrict your lifestyle.

However, every hard time follows a good one again, so you can already see a light at the end of the horizon. Hang in there a little longer, and you’ll be able to enjoy your old standard of living again.


### Personality
The Five of Pentacles reveals a rejectionist trait. The person does not want any help from outside, even in difficult situations, which makes it altogether more difficult for him to master crises.

Furthermore, this may refer to a worrying personality. Even in the case of small adversities, this person always immediately paints the worst scenarios putting an additional burden on himself.

### Past
In the recent past, you have suffered a painful loss. But instead of sinking into mourning, you should look ahead.

Someone rejected you very harshly some time ago. Do not judge the person too hastily before you know his motives.

### Future
You are facing a time of poverty. That can be on the material level as well as on the social level, so you should prepare yourself now.

There are great worries in you about your future, which are becoming more and more urgent. Try to find the causes of your fears and tackle them.

### Yes or No
With your question, you can lose something important to you. Therefore, you should not take a higher risk here and instead take the safe way.

A well-thought-out “no” decision will take away some of your stress and will be more in your favor in the future.
