## Tarot Card Meaning
The Hanged Man Tarot card indicates that we need a break in our lives at the moment. We may be involved in a big project, which is currently stagnating.

Instead of investing even more energy and time, we should take a moment to step back and pause. Because only in moments of rest and pauses we can find new strength and new ideas for the solution of a problem again.

Your mind unconsciously continues to work on a challenge, especially when you distract yourself with other things and then give you the obvious solution all by itself.

Especially in today’s performance-oriented society, breaks or interruptions are usually viewed very negatively. But just like in sports, rest and downtime allow you to unfold your full potential.

Sometimes your plans are slowed down by external forces or strokes of fate that you can hardly influence. Being at the mercy or powerlessness are normal parts of your life and show you that you cannot control everything around you, just like the card of The Hanged Man.

What you can influence are your thought patterns and perspectives on such situations. For example, a serious chronic illness is a daily struggle that you cannot avoid.

You will only have the inner strength to endure such illness if you learn how valuable your time of life is and use it accordingly. If you bury yourself in self-pity, you will only waste the energy needed for your recovery.

The Hanged Man Tarot card encourages us to change our perspective to look at things in a new way. Often we approach challenges or problems with old strategies of thought and action, as these have led to success in the past.

However, the world and the challenges that come with it are not rigid but in a constant state of change. Therefore, if you are currently stuck in a problem, try to write down all the possible ideas you can think of for the solution.

Such brainstorming works best if you are not afraid to include many initially irrational or “silly” ideas. That is the only way to open up new perspectives and generate a solution from them.


### Love: Single
In a love context, The Hanged Man shows that you have to learn to let go of short love affairs. If you have been single for a long time, you may be still clinging to ex-partners and are preventing yourself from getting to know someone new.

The new partner in your mind should be just like the previous one. Leave such old connections and longings behind and be curious how a new relationship can surprise you.

The Hanged Man Tarot card advises you to take a break in your partner search. Do not try to force or accelerate love. Instead, go into yourself, use the time out and gather new strength and energy for your next relationship.

### Love: Relationship
In a relationship, The Hanged Man Tarot card reminds you to look at your partnership from a new perspective. Especially if you have the feeling that the relationship is stagnating, try to discover new sides of yourself or your partner and live them out.

Qualities in your partner that bother you can be very useful for you as a couple, depending on the situation. We should not completely delete all the attributes that bother us in our partner. Instead, learn to love and appreciate the small and larger quirks.

The Hanged Man is also a sign that the partnership would benefit from a break from each other. In a narrower sense, a break means more time for oneself to date friends or practice a hobby without your partner.

In a broader sense, it can mean a break from your relationship, allowing both of you to reflect on the partnership in peace.


### Health  

In health matters, The Hanged Man represents a necessary break in your daily routine. Work, household, and family can quickly become a great burden if you have no opportunities for regeneration.

Allow yourself now and then small timeouts in everyday life, in which you can consciously relax body and mind and thus do something good for your health. In case of an illness, The Hanged Man reminds you not to concentrate so much on its symptoms.

Instead, let go of all thoughts and worries and accept your current situation. That will allow you to direct your energy to other things that bring you joy and distraction, thus indirectly contributing to faster healing.


### Career  

Regarding your career, the card of The Hanged Man reveals a dead end in which you currently find yourself. On the one hand, you don’t see any more chances for advancement in your job and on the other hand, you can’t give it up so easily.

Accept your current situation and consciously look for everyday aspects in your work that fulfill you. Whether it is a nice chat with colleagues or the beautiful view from the office, such small pleasures help you stay motivated and accept your current state.

The Hanged Man reminds you to take a break from work. You don’t have to be available all the time. Take time for yourself and your needs. Work won’t run away from you.


### Finances/Money  

In a financial context, The Hanged Man means that you should not constantly focus on money and material things. The constant preoccupation with your wealth can also lead to a burden that causes great stress in you.

Rather, focus on the things in life that money can’t buy, like friendships and love. These will give you the most satisfaction in life in the long run.

Maybe you have already invested a lot of money in a project that just doesn’t want to unfold. Consider carefully whether it is now time to back out of it and accept a manageable loss than to get into a debt trap later from which you can no longer get out so easily.


### Destiny  

The Hanged Man encourages you to remain calm even in difficult times of life and accept your fate. You can’t change certain circumstances in life.

You can only influence your view of things. That also determines whether you can grow in the challenges of life or let them paralyze you.


### Personality
The Hanged Man reveals a personality that gives up quickly. Instead of fighting and persist, he prefers to let go of his goal in order to save his strength.

Furthermore, the Hanged Man points to a character who is able to reinterpret any situation in his own sense. Such a change of perspective can make life easier or harder.

### Past
You should finally let go of certain relationships or experiences from your past and put your energy into meaningful activities instead.

Sometimes it can be helpful to look at past events again from a different perspective and thus gain new interpretations.

### Future
Plan for your future more breaks in your everyday life. Otherwise, you will quickly reach your limits.

You have firmly planned something for the near future and cannot think of anything else. Learn to let go and direct your focus to other important areas of your life.

### Yes or No
The last time, you dealt a lot with your difficult question. However, you have hardly made any progress in your deliberations and are stuck on the spot.

You should answer a decision that has been bothering you for a long time with a no until you get clear arguments and a better gut feeling for a yes.
