## Tarot Card Meaning
The Eight of Pentacles Tarot card encourages you not to slacken in your zeal to achieve your goals.

Only if you are ready to use all your energy and strength to make your dreams come true, you will see correspondingly satisfying results at the end of the day.

Have always your goal in mind because there will always be phases during your project that can hold some obstacles and set you back.

The more you progress in your project, the better your motivation is to master the last part of your way. Thereby you will mobilize unimagined energy reserves, which will help you to master the last hurdles before your goal.

Another meaning of the Eight of Pentacles is that you should always strive to increase your knowledge and skills and reach the highest level of perfection.

It is important to show good perseverance because mastery in a field requires many repetitions, the will to learn and constant reflection on your work.

The 10,000 rule states that you must invest at least 10,000 hours of hard, quality work to achieve excellence in an area.

But even 100 or 1000 hours of practice will make your skills and knowledge far above average. Therefore, try to spend a set amount of time on your skills every day and you will steadily increase your knowledge over time.

The Eight of Pentacles encourages you not to slacken your efforts and to carry out your plans. You have a very pedantic way of working and pay meticulous attention to every detail of your plans.

The high demands on your work require a great deal of time and effort from you. Only then your results will develop according to your ideas.

You treat every little detail with care and try to work it to the highest perfection so that your overall work is of high quality in the end.

Your effort and diligence will pay off and you will feel a deep satisfaction about your work and even your environment will recognize that you are a true master in your field.


### Love: Single
In a love Tarot context, the Eight of Pentacles shows that you should proceed in your search for a partner with a lot of perseverance and appropriate zeal.

Don’t immediately give in to setbacks or rejections, but use these experiences to learn from them and skillfully put them to use for you on your next dates.

Your inner motivation to find true love in your life will help you to get through difficult times of being alone and motivate you not to slacken in your efforts.

The Eight of Pentacles also shows that with enough diligence and perseverance you will find a new partner. For this, you must be ready to question and expand your knowledge about love where it is necessary.

Inform yourself on the Internet, books or friends about topics such as seduction, flirting or relationship life so that you can draw from a rich pool of knowledge when it comes to exploring love.

The important thing now is to put this knowledge into action and date other people regularly until you find a partner with whom you are ready to enter into a relationship.

### Love: Relationship
In a partnership, the Eight of Pentacles symbolizes that you are very pedantic when it comes to the organization of your relationship life. You pay attention to many little things with your partner in a positive and a negative sense.

Direct your focus more on your holistic relationship life, your feelings towards each other and your solidarity so that you can appreciate your partnership more again.

Another aspect of the Eight of Pentacles for you as a couple is, that together you should continue to expand your knowledge of each other and of love itself. There is always a new side to discover and learn from your partner, even if you think you know everything about your counterpart.

The more you know about each other, your strengths and weaknesses, the better you will be able to support and appreciate each other.

stay on the ball and don’t get distracted, your hard work will pay off in improved health.
