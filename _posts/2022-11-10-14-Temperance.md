## Tarot Card Meaning
Temperance encourages you to strive for balance and equilibrium in life. Especially when you are very upset, sad or anxious, you need to regroup internally to continue on your path and everyday life.

On the other hand, too much revelry and debauchery can also lead you astray from your destiny path. Your negative, as well as positive feelings, should always be kept in balance with each other.

Only then can you meet the challenges of life with much strength and balance and are not immediately thrown off course. Finding balance, however, means that minor deviations in your life’s path are necessary and important to bring you back into balance.

The Temperance Tarot card sets you up for inner peace and harmony. Look at all the positive things you have already achieved in life and focus on your upcoming projects, which will give you satisfaction.

Unfortunately, we often tend to criticize ourselves and pay more attention to our failures than successes. As a result, we experience many inner tensions and conflicts that can only be resolved when we learn to love and appreciate ourselves again.

When I am at peace with myself, I can achieve inner peace and harmony, and as a result, this will also radiate to those around me.

Another aspect of The Temperance card concerns our physical and mental health. Body and mind are a unity. If one of them is not well, this has immediate effects on the other part.

Often you experience in everyday life that you feel out of balance and feel inner restlessness. A little later, physical complaints in the back or head spread, affecting your mental well-being.

To break out of this cycle, it is important, to bring our thoughts and feelings back into balance by actively exposing ourselves to phases of physical relaxation.

Because when your body relaxes, your mind also comes to rest. In the next step, you can figure out how to get back on your path in life.


### Love: Single
In a love tarot reading, Temperance reveals a time of harmony in your love life. As a single, you will now be able to look for a partner with excitement and be at peace with yourself.

Your positive and balanced charisma will make it easy for you to meet new people and maybe even your true love. At the same time, Temperance reminds you to stay away from too much excess or extreme characters.

Rather look for people with whom you feel deeply connected and harmonize in many areas. You don’t need to have the same views in all areas.

It’s more about balancing and complementing each other positively in your nature and attitudes. Use the coming time to make many new experiences in love and feel how beneficial they are for your physical and mental well-being.

### Love: Relationship
In a relationship, the Temperance Tarot card shows that the partnership is currently in a very harmonious phase. Both partners complement each other in their characteristics and thus contribute to a well-balanced relationship.

Through this balance, you and your partner gain a lot of strength and energy necessary to stay on our path in life and overcome obstacles. Temperance encourages you to stick to your common goals and plans for the future and not to let other distractions or excesses divert you from your path.

As long as your partnership is based on harmony and peace, you will feel the positive effects of your partnership in all areas of your life.

Major conflicts in your partnership will be peacefully resolved as you both strive for harmony and thus settle a dispute in a solution-oriented and objective manner.


### Health  

Temperance signals a phase of life in which you can enjoy good health. We often take being healthy and vital for granted, but they are a great gift that we only learn to appreciate when we become seriously ill.

Seize the moment and continue to establish a healthy lifestyle so that you can prevent future illnesses. Furthermore, the Temperance card reveals the importance of balancing physical and mental health.

After all, a healthy body houses a healthy mind and vice versa. Continue to maintain the balance by sensing, in time, when one of the two poles is out of kilter and counteract accordingly.


### Career  

For your work, The Temperance encourages you to be in harmony with your teammates and superiors. As a team, you can master big challenges in your job together.

It’s okay to argue sometimes. However, the culture of conflict should follow certain rules so that the conflicting parties deal with each other in an appreciative and solution-oriented manner.

Another meaning of Temperance for your career is that your work fills you with great satisfaction. That makes you feel balanced and automatically less sick and stressed, which in turn has a positive effect on the overall working atmosphere of your company.


### Finances/Money  

In a financial context, The Temperance Tarot card means that you should adjust your lifestyle according to your income. A simple rule here is not to spend more than you have available and always keep a nest egg for a rainy day.

This way, you will always have a balanced account and won’t have to worry about how you’ll get through the next month. In addition, Temperance means that a certain level of wealth can increase your satisfaction.

Try to find out your individual level of wealth and work towards it. We don’t all have to be millionaires, but a good financial cushion and modest luxuries can increase our happiness.


### Destiny  

For your destiny, the Temperance Tarot card reveals a time of happiness, when you bring all areas of your life into harmony with each other. Regularly check how satisfied you are with your life right now.

Try to recognize imbalances in your everyday life early on and correct them accordingly. The more you balance your life, the stronger you are against unexpected adversity and experience deep fulfillment.


### Personality
The Temperance shows a character who is always trying to create harmony for himself and for his environment. He often contributes to the resolution of conflicts and a positive coexistence.

Likewise, this card refers to a personality that tries to balance hia faults and weaknesses with the help of hia skills and strengths.

### Past
You have taken good care of your health in the past. You can see the fruits of your actions by your well-being in the present.

Lately, you often think back to past days of peace and happiness. Keep your inner peace as a basis for your further actions.

### Future
In the future, you will have to be careful to balance upcoming challenges efficiently. You can achieve this through activities that give you relaxation and strength.

At the same time, you are facing a phase of harmony. With your current actions, you lay an important foundation for this.

### Yes or No
Although the arguments clearly speak for a no, you are still delaying your decision. Something in you does not want to face the facts and therefore delays the answer to your question.

Even if you now detain your decision even longer, the arguments for a no will not become less.
