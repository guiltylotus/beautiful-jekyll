## Tarot Card Meaning
In a tarot reading, the Nine of Wands stands for persevering stamina that lets you master even the most difficult situations in life. You may be on the verge of completing a life goal.

But just before reaching your goal, you experience heavy resistance, which throws you back again.

Don’t lie there devastated, but get up again and fight your way forward. With enough perseverance, you will be able to make your dreams come true and emerge stronger from difficult situations.

At the same time, with your perseverance, you will increase your resilient skills, which will enable you to stay mentally healthy and enjoy your life to the fullest, despite the most adverse circumstances.

Another meaning of the Nine of Wands is that you must be ready to defend your values and goals to your fellow human beings. Especially if you are very successful in one area, this will bring many envious people who want to dispute your happiness.

Do not bend unnecessarily only to please others or for the sake of peace, because such people will always find things to criticize you about to put you down.

Instead, steadfastly represent your dreams and opinions in life and do not let them be disputed from the outside. You can also gather other well-meaning people around you so that you experience better support and can fend off attacks on you better.

The Tarot card of the Nine of Wands warns you to be careful about what you reveal to others. Not everyone in your social environment is sympathetic to you. The person does not show you their dislike openly but acts covertly against you.

You may have a favorable opportunity to advance professionally or acquire a property at a reasonable price. Even if the temptation is great to share this great news with everyone you know, you should hold back at first.

Keep a promising opportunity for yourself so that no one else snatches your chance from under your nose. Forewarned is forearmed.


### Love: Single
As a single, the Nine of Wands encourages you to be persistent in your efforts to find a partner. Finding true love in life is often a rocky road that holds some obstacles for you.

Experienced setbacks or rejections will help you to reflect on yourself and avoid making the same mistakes in the future.

In time, you will become more confident in your search for a partner and may unexpectedly find the new love of your life. But only if you get up again and again after each fall and keep running, you will meet the love destined for you.

The Nine of Wands also warns you to be on your guard in a new love affair. Your counterpart’s motives are not entirely sincere and he seems to be hiding something from you. Do not be blinded by the first infatuation, but listen to your inner voice.

Your gut feeling will quickly tell you if something is wrong. In this case, you should not rush and carefully intensify your relationship. Be on your guard and rely on your intuition so that you do not experience any unpleasant surprises.

### Love: Relationship
In a partnership, the Nine of Wands stands for the necessity to defend yourself more against your partner.

You put up with too much in your life together and do not stand up for your own interests. At the moment, our partner dominates the daily events and does not consider your needs.

Learn to defend yourself when you have the feeling that your partner ignores you. Sometimes your partner is not even aware that you sometimes feel “overrun”.

The more often you practice defending yourself against attacks on your wishes or concerns, the easier it will be to assert your needs.

Furthermore, the Nine of Wands in a relationship stands for the ability to continue to stand together as a couple despite the most challenging life crises.

Such cohesion is only possible through a deep relationship of trust and an optimistic attitude.

You give each other support in times of greatest need. As a result, your life together becomes an inexhaustible source of strength and hope that will accompany you throughout your lives.


### Health

For your health, the Nine of Wands reveals that you are still struggling with a persistent illness. The symptoms demand your last reserves of strength.

Nevertheless, continue to hold out and make sure that you divide your remaining energy well. Your recovery is already underway and soon you will feel yourself getting better bit by bit.

The Nine of Wands can also herald the return of a chronic illness or old wound. You should therefore be careful and not put yourself under unnecessary stress.

An early visit to the doctor can also prevent worse and you can take countermeasures
in time. Even if a complete cure is often not possible, you can at least alleviate your symptoms.


### Career

In professional terms, the Nine of Wands stands for high resistance to strong stressors in the job. Whether it’s bullying or a heavy workload, so far, you’ve done well and not let it get you down.

But keep in mind that such challenges demand a lot of strength from your body and mind. Therefore, you should always plan recovery phases to keep your power up.

The Nine of Wands symbolizes that you have to defend yourself against unjustified attacks regarding your work performance. Don’t put up with everything and set clear boundaries if the bullying becomes too personal. Seek support from other employees or the works council.


### Finances/Money

For your finances, the Nine of Wands means that despite some setbacks you still have a solid money cushion at your disposal. As long as you don’t invest beyond your means, it’s worth taking a risk now and then.

A healthy portfolio can handle a few failures or unexpected events. Just don’t forget to refresh your reserves again and again.

Furthermore, the Nine of Wands stands for increased vigilance with your finances. Watch out for free bait offers if they sound too good to be true.

Because often high costs are hidden in the fine print. Also, check regularly whether outgoing transactions are executed correctly and not too much is taken from the account.


### Destiny 

For your destiny, the Nine of Wands encourages you to stick to your goals, even if the way to get there requires some strength from you. The greater the challenge ahead of you, the more you will grow from it.

You are capable of much more than you might think at first. Trust in your dormant potentials and fulfill your dreams.


### Personality
The Nine of Wands stands for an extremely resilient personality. This person finds something positive in every life crisis and emerge strengthened from them.

Furthermore, a character is described here who persistently pursues his goals. Even if unexpected hurdles stand in his way, he accepts the delay and continues to stay on the ball.

### Past
You have shown great perseverance in achieving your goals in the past. Your perseverance is a good basis for further plans.

So far, you have mastered life crises amazingly well. That has increased your resilience, which watches over you like a protective shield.

### Future
Be careful not to expose yourself to unnecessary risks in the future. Your caution can save you from greater harm.

Soon, you will have to defend yourself against some unjustified attacks. Use your mind and intuition to decide the conflict for you.

### Yes or No
Be careful with your question! There are many aspects here, which you have not considered so far, but which have a great influence on your choice.

With a no-answer, you minimize most of the risks for yourself and can devote yourself to other topics without any worries.
