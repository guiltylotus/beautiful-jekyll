## Tarot Card Meaning
The Tower Tarot card symbolizes profound transformations that we go through in life. Such changes are usually the result of unexpected twists of fate for which we cannot prepare, such as relationship breakups, accidents, job loss.

Our mental constructions, built up with great effort over the years, are completely destroyed by the stroke of fate, as in the case of the tower, and leave behind great chaos.

But only out of this chaos a new order can be created again, enabling us to accept our fate and not break because of it. We build a flexible thought framework on the remains of our old thought patterns, which can better cope with the next storm in life and do not oppose it.

Another aspect of The Tower Tarot card is the release from entrenched structures. Often we are trapped in very rigid patterns in everyday life, which on the one hand, give us security and, on the other hand, prevent us from getting out of them and thus hinder us in our spiritual development.

By tearing down the rigid walls around you or, like the two people on The Tower card, by leaping into the unknown, you free yourself from rigid restrictions and can discover the world anew.

The price of this freedom is that you leave behind the supposed security of your rigid patterns and are in free fall, so to speak. But out of this initial fear, new courage will arise to face new challenges and grow from them.

The Tower signals great chaos and confusion in your life. You lose our grip, as the order in our lives, believed to be safe and firm, will be deeply shaken. But chaos often means nothing more than change and is thus a natural process in our lives.

We always label change as chaotic when it goes against our ideas of how the world should work. By embracing chaos as a natural process of change, we can take these profound changes as a celestial sign helping us restructure our lives and making us more adaptable and resilient.


### Love: Single
In a love Tarot context, The Tower Tarot card signals an awakening from a dream, so to speak. As a single, you sometimes have blinders on your eyes and hang behind a love affair that has no chance of a deeper relationship.

Through good friends or incisive events, you wake up from your dream world and realize that your adored partner in the real world feels nothing for you and loves only him-/herself. The Tower can also point to emotional chaos in us.

The trigger of this chaos can be an unexpected rejection or intense feelings towards someone that suddenly overtake you. Such a confusion of emotions is quite natural and shows that you are a very sensitive person and react strongly to your environment.

Take some time for yourself and first distance yourself from the person in question so that you can sort out your feelings again. Then you can better listen to your inner voice and decide what to do.

### Love: Relationship
In a partnership, the Tower card reveals that a big change is about to happen. Relationships are constantly experiencing influences that affect them in positive and negative ways.

By facing the next challenge together, such as birth, marriage, or moving in together, you will grow stronger as a team. Be aware that any change will require an adjustment effort from both partners, as too much rigidity risks breaking the relationship.

The Tower can signal that the relationship is very chaotic and in danger of breaking up. If you have recognized where the chaos comes from, you can try to restore order.

However, you can only do it together with your partner. Depending on how he reacts to your attempt to create order, you will have certainty about the basis of your relationship.


### Health 

For your health, the Tower Tarot card means that you experience high levels of stress. You put yourself under a lot of pressure. You always want to handle all demands at once and think too little about your own needs.

Bring some order back into your inner chaos and increase your well-being, through more rest and relaxation phases. The Tower can also be a sign of a positive change in your health after a serious illness.

Even if you have almost lost hope for the alleviation of your symptoms, a turn in the course of the disease is now emerging, which will take away some of your sufferings.


### Career 

In a career Tarot reading, The Tower means that profound changes are coming to your company that will affect all employees. The change of a workplace is usually a bit chaotic at the beginning and can cause fears and doubts for all involved.

Wait patiently until the worst of the storm has passed by. Then, focus on the opportunities and potentials associated with the change. In addition, The Tower encourages you to free yourself from the burdens and fears associated with your job.

You can partly bring about such release yourself by looking for new career prospects or changing your own expectations of your work.


### Finances/Money  

Concerning financial matters, The Tower warns you that the overview of your finances threatens to slip away. Bills are piling up and your account is slowly but surely slipping into the red.

A budget book can help to bring back order into your financial chaos if you keep it regularly. An upcoming change in your life, such as a move or buying a house, can lead to the fact that you come to the edge of your financial possibilities and, in the worst case, go insolvent.

In addition, many unexpected burdens can come, which quickly overstretch your account. Therefore, keep a close eye on your finances and set aside a small reserve that you can fall back on in an emergency.


### Destiny  

For your destiny, The Tower means profound changes in your life. Sometimes such strokes of fate can lead to a chaotic time in your life.

The sooner you can adapt to new circumstances and remain calm, the better you will weather the unexpected storms of life unscathed.


### Personality
The Tower stands for a person who shows a high willingness to change. No matter what difficult challenges he faces, he does everything to adapt accordingly.

Furthermore, the Tower symbolizes a chaotic character who has problems structuring his day. Often the person does too many things in parallel and thus loses the overview.

### Past
You long for redemption from a past stroke of fate. Only you can provide this relief by accepting it as a part of your biography.

Your chaotic past still keeps you busy and prevents the structure from coming into your everyday life.

### Future
A profound change is in the offing for your near future. Even if it causes worry and uncertainty in you at first, it can also be the beginning of a happy time.

You are about to gain a decisive insight. It is like waking up from a dream that has become real.

### Yes or No
The situation you are in is sometimes very chaotic. For this reason, you should tend to say no, so that the consequences remain manageable for you.

Otherwise, you may have to make further decisions head over heels, with even more serious consequences for you.
