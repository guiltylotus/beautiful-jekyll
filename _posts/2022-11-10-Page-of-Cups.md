## Tarot Card Meaning
The Page of Cups Tarot card encourages us to give more free rein to our curiosity. The urge to discover and explore something new is unfortunately only slightly developed in many adults. If we take children as an example, we learn to discover our world from a new perspective.

Because only if we regularly critically question our environment and our factual knowledge about it, we realize how much we still have to discover, which eludes the logical, rational mind.

Be open to new experiences, like a fish looking out of the cup, and dare to explore new ideas and dreams. You will be surprised how many new paths will open up to you if you dare to look for them.

The Page of Cups is also a sign to give more space to your creativity and emotionality. A new idea usually arises quite unexpectedly without us having to force it. Often it is enough if we listen to our inner voice.

Like our inner child, it helps to remain unprejudiced and curious and to appreciate every new thought accordingly. Creativity is a process that is naturally present in every human being and gives us a small taste of the immeasurable wisdom of our subconscious.

The ideas and desires that emerge from this process are worthy of not remaining mere reveries but being shared with those around us, allowing them to participate in our creative creation.

Another meaning of the Page of Cups is to reconnect with our inner child. That means trusting our intuition and inner feeling more again, especially with difficult decisions lying ahead.

To re-establish contact with our inner child, we can practice meditation, yoga or the tarot, for example. Our intuition is like a messenger that sends us new surprising insights from our subconscious and invites us to use them for ourselves.

Often, several cognitive or emotional messages from the depths of our consciousness make their way to the surface and result in our intuition, which sends us an important signal for an upcoming change or decision in our life.


### Love: Single
The Page of Cups card conveys to you as a single that some surprises await you in love. By approaching other persons openly and light-heartedly and getting in touch with them, you will receive some unexpected positive reactions.

Love does not develop according to a structured plan but comes to us unexpectedly and surprisingly, with people and in places which we least expected.

By keeping your childlike curiosity and not being afraid to venture into uncharted waters, your love life will hold some surprises for you.

The Page of Cups also encourages you to trust your intuition more than your rational mind when choosing a partner.

We sometimes meet people who are very similar to us, like have the same hobbies, the same profession or music style, whereupon our mind and our friends say “he is a perfect match for you!”.

But a small persistent voice or feeling deep inside you says that a relationship with this person will not last long.

This voice or feeling is your intuition, which is especially in matters of love far ahead of your mind and tells you early on whether someone fits you or not.

### Love: Relationship
In a relationship, the Page of Cups encourages you to live out your emotional sides. Share your feelings with your partner, whether fear, sadness, or joy, and be willing to learn about your partner’s emotions.

Sharing our feelings keeps a partnership very alive and creates a place of trust where we don’t have to hold back our emotions.

According to the old proverb: “A sorrow shared is a sorrow halved, a joy shared is a joy doubled!” more emotionality in the relationship ensures a more harmonious and happier life together.

In a partnership, the Page of Cups also stands for curiosity about the other partner. Even if we think we already know our partner inside out, we can discover new sides of him every day, which surprise us again.

By getting to know each other in different ways, your relationship will be rich in surprising and fulfilling moments.


### Health

For your health, the Page of Cups encourages you to trust your inner feeling more. In case of symptoms like migraine or mood swings, it usually helps to get in touch with your subconscious to find the causes.

If you have discovered the corresponding blockages, you can solve them with the help of your inner strength and thus restore your well-being.

In addition, the Page of Cups stands for surprising but positive news regarding your health.

That can be, for example, a test result that turns out much better than expected or a milder diagnosis than previously predicted. With the information received, you can finally take the necessary steps for your healing process.


### Career

Professionally, the Page of Cups encourages you to bring new ideas into your job. Often, many ideas pop into our heads throughout the day about how to better solve certain problems at work.

Don’t just let your creativity flow away, but write down your thoughts, no matter how “crazy” they may be at first. Afterward, you can look at your ideas again in peace and choose some that seem promising.

The Jack of Cups also stands for maintaining your curiosity on the job. By constantly expanding your knowledge about your field of work, not only will your skills increase, but you will also be able to build a positive relationship with your job so that your motivation to work increases.


### Finances/Money 

Financially, the Page of Cups stands for using your creativity to build up your wealth. For example, you could see if a private hobby of yours can provide you with a little extra income.

If you like sewing, music or painting anyway, you can use your talents to earn some extra money without learning anything new.

Another aspect of the Jack of Cups is to trust your intuition more in financial matters. If you have a bad inner feeling about a contract or a money transaction, you should investigate it.

In case of doubt, you should rather leave such transactions or postpone them until later, when you have clarified your inner doubt.


### Destiny 

As a fate card, the Page of Cups reveals to explore the world with a childlike curiosity. Through this, you will always discover new secrets and additionally train your intuition.

Your inner feeling will accompany you throughout your life and show you the right way when making difficult decisions.


### Personality
The Page of Cups represents a character who is strongly connected to his emotions. Both positive and negative feelings are usually experienced very intensely by this person guiding him on his path.

Likewise, it can mean a person who is curious by nature. He is interested in many things and is usually not satisfied with simple answers but wants to know every detail.

### Past
In earlier times, your curiosity led you to many an adventure. Bring it back to life and you will discover wonderful things.

Your feelings have strongly influenced your behavior in the past. Be sure to include your mind as well.

### Future
Trust your intuition because it will soon show you which direction you should take on your life path.

Challenges await you in the near future, which you can only meet with creative solutions. Therefore, let yourself be guided by your inner voice.

### Yes or No
Your intuition sends you conflicting signals regarding your question. There are strong doubts in you regarding a positive answer.

A rushed choice can quickly put you in front of some hurdles. Therefore, you should decide on a no to wait for what happens next.
