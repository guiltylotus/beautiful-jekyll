## Tarot Card Meaning
The Lovers tarot card shows our deepest emotional connections to those around us. Whether it’s your partner, a very good friend, or someone in your family, we as humans can connect deeply with a variety of people (some people even with animals), allowing us to develop freely.

Just like The Lovers, we don’t need to hide anything but can open up to the other person in a completely unbiased way.

That means that you can freely and openly reveal your innermost thoughts and feelings without fear of being laughed at or betrayed. On the contrary, you experience compassion and help from the person in question.

At the same time, you give the person the same unbiased openness concerning their problems, like through active listening or concrete assistance.

On a more personal level, The Lovers card embodies the creation of our inner values and beliefs. In contrast to the Hierophant, where a strict and predetermined moral model is given, The Lovers encourage you to create and live your own values.

Through the many life experiences you have already made, you are better and better able to decide for yourself which values help you on the path to spiritual maturity and which ideas are no longer necessary at the moment.

Especially in times when your moral values are questioned and you have to make an important decision for yourself, it is best to rely on your values.

The Lovers are also a symbol of great loyalty to other people and your own values and faith. Faithfulness means that despite numerous distractions or temptations in everyday life, we do not let ourselves be distracted but stand by our made promises or values.

The apple tree with the snake on the Lovers Tarot card symbolizes the temptations that directly surround us. The woman, for example, looks towards the sky and searches for a piece of advice to resist the temptation.

One possibility can be to discuss such temptations with a good friend or a spiritual teacher, to find together back on your path of knowledge.


### Love: Single
The Lovers card is one of the most important Tarot cards in a Love Tarot context. As a single, it means that you can soon find your True Love who will accompany you on your further path in life.

Be open and without reservations, like the man and the woman in the picture of The Lovers, and the path to your True Love will soon reveal itself. Above all, try to be true to yourself and not bend your inner values for someone else just to get their attention.

Finding True Love does not mean that both partners agree on all life issues. Rather, they complement each other in different values and attitudes, like a key that fits a certain lock.

It is important that you can reveal yourself to your love without shame and shyness and that the other one treats you with appreciation.

### Love: Relationship
In a relationship, The Lovers card means that you have found your True Love. You are soul mates who have no secrets from each other and know your counterpart in and out.

By knowing the strengths and weaknesses of your partner, you can master even the most difficult situations in life together and grow from them. Your relationship is characterized by the deepest, mutual trust and appreciation for each other.

With that trust, you experience a very profound and harmonious partnership, which gives you both a deep inner fulfillment and meaning in life. Another meaning in a relationship is faithfulness to each other, also symbolized by The Lovers.

Finding someone who will accompany you through ups and downs and stand by you is a true rarity and a precious treasure that you should guard.

Another meaning can be that you can create a harmonious relationship between two people. That can be a completely new relationship or a reconciliation between two conflicting parties.


### Health

Regarding health issues, The Lovers card reveals the importance of support from friends or your partner to speed up the healing process.

Both emotional and practical help will have a positive effect on your recovery process and at the same time strengthen the bond of friendship with your loved ones.

Furthermore, The Lovers card indicates illnesses that have to do with the heart. That does not necessarily affect the organs. It can also appear in the form of heartache in the field of love.

The healing of such ailments also comes through caring persons around you who share your suffering and thus contribute to the alleviation of your pain.


### Career

At work, The Lovers card stands for a high level of teamwork. It’s simply easier to work together and even challenging tasks are easier to accomplish as a team.

Divide yourselves according to your strengths and weaknesses, so that you can complement each other perfectly. In addition, The Lovers card represents loyalty to your company.

You have experienced both ups and downs in your company, but your colleagues and superiors have proven to be a good support and functioning team. Be thankful for your job and the people who put a smile on your face every day, even when work isn’t so much fun.


### Finances/Money
From a financial point of view, The Lovers represent a good time to look again more closely at what values are important in life besides money. Certain prosperity should not lead us to accumulate even more money, but on the contrary, share our wealth with loved ones.

If you are currently in a difficult financial situation, you should consult someone who has already helped you in the past with advice and action.

That can be your bank advisor, a good friend or relative with whom you have built up a deep relationship of trust over the years. This person will help you get back on your feet. Together you will get your finances back in order.


### Destiny

As a destiny card, The Lovers reveal how important it is to have a soul mate in your life. That can be a good friend or partner who will support you in any situation.

When your bond is so strong that you understand each other without words, you can communicate only with your heart. This way, the other person knows exactly what is going on inside you and how you feel and can give you emotional and practical support accordingly.


### Personality
The Lovers stand for a loyal character that can always be relied upon. Never would the one betray his friends or family, but would give everything to protect them from harm.

Furthermore, solid values in life are important to such a personality. They give her support and orientation in an ever faster-changing world.

### Past
An old love from days gone by is bothering you again. Maybe you should get in touch again and see what happens.

The values of your parents and grandparents are still valid in some respects, no matter how old they may be.

### Future
New and promising relationships await you soon. A wonderful connection can spring from every encounter with a person.

Love will continue to knock on your door in the future. Therefore, be very attentive and let it enter your heart as well.

### Yes or No
You can hope for the unrestricted support of a good friend/partner with this question, which is why the answer tends strongly to a yes.

Perhaps you can also make this decision together and thus remove any remaining doubts that have so far stood in the way of a clear answer.
