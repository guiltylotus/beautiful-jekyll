## Tarot Card Meaning
The Six of Pentacles Tarot card represents the great responsibility connected with one’s wealth and influence.

By using your financial and social power to help other people, you will make an important contribution to more justice and thus harmony in society, at least in your immediate environment.

Often small to medium-sized projects, such as a local charity event or a fundraising appeal, will enable you to implement projects that enrich your neighborhood, for example, a new playground, or the expansion of barrier-free city centers.

Use your available resources to create a better world for yourself and the people around you. You will reap much gratitude and appreciation worth more than all the riches in the world.

Another characteristic of the Six of Pentacles is, that you share your skills and wealth with others, to the benefit of all concerned. In doing so, weigh well who you give what resources to, based on the degree to which they need help.

It makes a difference whether someone needs money for a new car, even though they already have one, or for a car to get to work.

Your support should include not only financial aspects but also practical support, for example, help with renovations or advice on difficult decisions.

You should always consider giving only as much as the needy person needs to get back on their own feet and not become dependent on you.

The Six of Pentacles also encourages you to accept help and gifts from other people and to practice gratitude. Maybe it is difficult for you to accept support from outside because you don’t want to be a burden to anyone and you are used to solving your problems yourself.

However, there are always strokes of fate or challenges in life that we can hardly cope with alone and are therefore dependent on the help of our fellow human beings.

Do not reject offers of help unnecessarily, but show your gratitude and accept the support. When you stand on your own two feet again, you can return the support given to you and maintain the cycle of giving and take.


### Love: Single
In a Love Tarot reading, the Six of Pentacles stands for being generous in your dating and not being unnecessarily stingy. The first impression on a date is often the most important.

Therefore you should make an effort to act generously, for example, by paying the bill for your dinner or trip to the cinema.

Furthermore, you will leave a lasting impression if you can freely share your thoughts and feelings with your counterpart and thus clearly express your interest in the person in question.

The Six of Pentacles, on the other hand, stands for not brusquely rejecting acknowledgments and small gestures of affection in love, but gratefully accept them.

Especially in dating, you may be annoyed by the same compliments at some point and can no longer accept them.

But your partner often does not know that you have already received many similar compliments and just wants to express his affection for you.

Instead of knocking him on the head, you should be happy about the compliments you receive and appreciate them for what they are, the expression of love for your person.

### Love: Relationship
In a partnership, the Six of Pentacles symbolizes that you as a couple enjoy great material and spiritual prosperity.

Through your good cooperation and division of tasks in your relationship, you have built up an impressive wealth, which you continue to increase through your love for each other.

You have also realized that your well-being as a couple also depends on how your social environment is doing. By assisting your friends and relatives in various life situations with your wealth, you not only help your loved ones but also continue to grow together as partners.

The Six of Pentacles encourages you as a couple to share your worries and hardships and also the beautiful things that happen to you in everyday life.

This way, you will always get the best and most reliable help in upcoming challenges in your life and always be aware that your partner stands behind you and gives you support.

Sharing beautiful aspects of your everyday life also shows your partner that they are an important part of your life. They will feel loved and valued accordingly. Because as a couple, you share your lives in both good times and bad.


### Health

For your health, the Six of Pentacles means that you should accept help from those around you. Especially if you have severe symptoms, support with everyday tasks like shopping or cleaning can be very helpful.

You don’t have to do everything yourself, but you can accept help from others. Then you will also recover faster because you can put all your strength into your healing.

Another aspect of the Six of Pentacles is to offer help to those around you who are ill. Even small errands like getting the mail or something in town are a great relief for a sick person.

At the same time, you can build on support in case you get sick because you have helped others.


### Meaning

In a career reading, the Six of Pentacles reveals that you have responsibility for colleagues. Especially in a leadership position you also have a duty of care towards your employees.

In case of difficulties, you should be available for advice and support. Situations will arise in which you will also be dependent on your employees.

Another characteristic of the Six of Pentacles is that you receive monetary recognition for your work. Such appreciation may take the form of a promotion or a raise.

If you continue to work with motivation and diligence, your wealth will continue to increase. In addition to material recognition, you will also receive personal appreciation.


### Finances/Money

In a financial context, the Six of Pentacles represents great prosperity coming your way. Often such an increase in wealth is the result of hard work and dedication.

Do not be too modest and reap the fruits of your labor or accept appropriate gifts (salary increase, bonus payment).

Another meaning of the Six of Pentacles is to share your wealth with your fellow man. A small donation can make a big difference in other countries of the world and even save lives.

Look also in your immediate environment. There are always people who depend on financial help. Even small donations can help those people in getting along. The joy you bring to others through your gifts is more precious than all the money in the world.


### Destiny 

As a destiny card, the Six of Pentacles means that you should share your knowledge and skills with those around you. Unlike material values, your knowledge enables a much more sustainable support of your environment.

Thus, at the same time, you are also a role model for others to share their skills with the whole world, thus helping as many people as possible.


### Personality
The Six of Pentacles reveals a character who likes to share with others. He knows that by doing so, he will also encourage others to do good and help thier fellow man.

Likewise, this can mean an extremely grateful person. Such a person can accept support and help and not go through everything alone out of false pride.

### Past
You still feel uncomfortable because you accepted a favor some time ago. But the person did you a service of his own free will, for which you should be grateful.

In the past, you have enjoyed good periods of prosperity. Always be aware that such things cannot be taken for granted.

### Future
Soon, you should share something important to you with someone. That will teach you how valuable it is to give to other people.

Try not to be too stingy in the future. You only live once and you should treat yourself once in a while and be generous to yourself.

### Yes or No
When making this decision, you should also consider the influence your choice will have on the people around you.

With a yes, you can not only help yourself but also many other people in your environment. Thus your action causes a harmonization of your environment.
